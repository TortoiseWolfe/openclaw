## Key Concepts

A Marubozu is a candlestick charting formation showing that a security's price stayed within its opening and closing range. It is a candlestick pattern that lacks a shadow . A Marubozu indicates market sentiment, such as strong buying or selling pressure, and this can influence trading decisions. The name Marubozu comes from the Japanese word for "close-cropped", indicating a candle with no shadow. A Marubozu is defined by the lack of upper or lower shadows, keeping within the day's price range. On an up day, the opening price is equal to the day's low, and the closing price is equal to the day's high. On days that the stock has gained, it is indicative of a bull market , and on days that it has lost, it is indicative of a bear market . On up days, demand for the stock exceeds supply. Or at least a greater demand for the stock than there is a willingness to sell it. The opposite can be said on losing, or down days. Candlestick charting has been popular since the days of Japanese rice merchants and rice traders. They referred to the wide part of the candlestick as the real body, and they would use it to determine whether the closing price had risen above or fallen below the opening price. When a Marubozu type of candle is found in an uptrend , it is used to signal that the bulls are aggressively buying the asset and it suggests that the momentum may continue upward. The bullish Marubozu candle (open equals low, high equals close) can signal a reversal when it is found at the end of a downtrend because it shows that the sentiment has changed and that the bulls are likely to continue pushing the asset higher. On the other hand, a bearish Marubozu found in a downtrend (open equals high, low equals close) can signal further selling pressure, especially if found at the top of an uptrend. Charting activity on the stock market isn’t a new idea. Analysts have charted since before the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) existed, though in simpler forms than today. Charts provide an easy-to-follow visual of stock market activity. Without taking into consideration the reasons behind declines or growth, charts track the changes and show activity over time. Even a casual investor can read charts once they understand the basics of what they are tracking. This will give an investor the information they potentially need to make decisions based on what is happening throughout the market. Charts show what is heavily traded, helping investors decide to follow trends or target less popular assets. Note that charts track various features, so pay attention to the specific data presented. Some charts show daily activity, while others track weekly or monthly trends. For a larger, more comprehensive picture, an investor may want to review many different charts to see changes over both short-term and long-term periods before making decisions. A Marubozu is a candlestick charting formation with no shadow, indicating a strong market conviction. It signals bullish or bearish market conditions and potential trend reversals. Charts such as Marubozu can aid both novice and experienced traders in making informed decisions by visualizing market trends and stock activity. Candlestick charting has been utilized since the days of Japanese rice merchants. Investors should consider multiple chart types and timeframes to gain a comprehensive understanding of market conditions before making any decisions.
