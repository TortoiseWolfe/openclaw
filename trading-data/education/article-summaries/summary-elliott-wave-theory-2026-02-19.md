## Key Concepts

Here’s a summary of what we covered regarding the Elliott Wave Theory : Elliott Waves are fractals. Each wave can be split into parts, each of which is a very similar copy of the whole. Mathematicians like to call this property “self-similarity”. A trending market moves in a 5-3 wave pattern. The first 5-wave pattern is called impulse wave. One of the three impulse waves (1, 3, or 5) will always be extended. Wave 3 is usually the extended one. The second 3-wave pattern is called a corrective wave. Letters A, B, and C are used instead of numbers to track the correction. Waves 1, 3 and 5, are made up of a smaller 5-wave impulse pattern while Waves 2 and 4 are made up of smaller 3-wave corrective patterns. There are 21 types of corrective patterns but they are just made up of three very simple, easy-to-understand formations. The three fundamental corrective wave patterns are zig-zags , flats , and triangles . Three Cardinal Rules There are three cardinal rules in Elliott Wave Theory when labeling waves: Rule Number 1: Wave 3 can NEVER be the shortest impulse wave Rule Number 2: Wave 2 can NEVER go beyond the start of Wave 1 Rule Number 3: Wave 4 can NEVER cross in the same price area as Wave 1 If you look hard enough at a chart, you’ll see that the market really does move in waves. Because the forex market never moves in a textbook-perfect fashion, it will take many, many hours of practice analyzing waves before you start to get comfortable with Elliott waves. Stay diligent and never give up!
