## Key Concepts

A stop-loss order is a critical tool for traders aiming to curtail potential losses or secure gains from their existing positions. By dictating that a security is bought or sold at market when it hits a predetermined stop price, traders can effectively manage and limit risk exposure. Unlike a stop-limit order, which might not execute, a stop-loss order guarantees execution (provided there are market participants) when the stop price is met. This method of risk management is essential in volatile markets, offering a safeguard when prices move unfavorably. For instance, if a stock you own depreciates by a set percentage, a stop-loss order helps ensure it is sold at the best available price, protecting your investment portfolio from further downfall.

A stop-loss order to sell tells a broker to sell if a security's market price drops to or below the stop price. Conversely, a stop-loss order to buy is set above the current market price. When a security hits the stop price, a stop-loss order becomes a market order to sell at the best price available. Meanwhile, a stop-limit order might not execute if the security doesn't reach the limit price, so stop-loss orders help ensure the position closes even if prices drop further. A downside to stop-loss orders is price gaps. If a stock's price gaps past the stop price, the order triggers, and the stock is sold (or bought) at the next available price, regardless of a sharp price move. Another disadvantage concerns getting stopped out in a choppy market that quickly reverses itself and resumes in the direction that was beneficial to your position. Investors can use a trailing stop with a stop-loss order for more flexibility. A trailing stop adjusts its stop price based on a set percentage or amount above or below the market price, locking in profits as prices rise while protecting against losses. Traders might also use option contracts instead of stop orders to better control their exit price points. A trader buys 100 shares of XYZ Company for $100 and sets a stop-loss order at $90. The stock declines over the next few weeks and falls below $90. The trader's stop-loss order is triggered, and the position is sold at $89.95, resulting in a minor loss. The market continues trending downward. A trader buys 500 shares of ABC at $100, setting a stop-loss at $90. After bad earnings are reported, the price drops at opening. The stop-loss triggers at $90, limiting the loss despite the market dropping further to close at $49.50. It's an order placed once you've taken a position in a security (on the buy side or sell side) with instructions to close out your position by selling (or buying) the security at the market if the price of the security reaches a specific level. A stop-loss order limits your exposure to less of a loss than you might otherwise experience by automatically closing out your position if your stock trades to an unfavorable market price level that you designate. If you use a trailing stop with your stop-loss order, that protection can move with your position even as it increases in value. So, a loss could translate to less profit rather than a complete loss. Probably not. Long-term investors shouldn't be overly concerned with market fluctuations because they're in the market for the long haul and can wait for it to recover from downturns. However, they can and should evaluate market drops to determine if some action is called for. For example, a downturn could provide the opportunity to add to their positions, rather than to exit them.
