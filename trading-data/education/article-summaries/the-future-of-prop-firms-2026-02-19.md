## Key Concepts

If you’re a beginner looking at prop firms today, you might be wondering: Will prop firms still be around in a few years? Are they just a fad, or will they evolve into something more sustainable? How might regulation, technology, and market trends change the game? This lesson matters because your decision to engage with prop firms should also consider their long-term viability. Understanding where the industry is heading helps you: Set realistic expectations. Choose firms that are likely to survive. Plan your own path beyond prop firms. How the Industry Has Changed: From Fast Money to Serious Business The proprietary trading firm industry has gone through dramatic changes in just a few years. What started as a gold rush, with new companies popping up everywhere and traders flocking to easy opportunities, has transformed into a more mature, carefully managed business. Understanding these three stages helps explain why some firms have failed, why rules keep changing, and where the industry is headed. Let’s break down each phase. Stage 1: The Boom Years (2020–mid-2023) It was easy to start a prop trading firm. Anyone with some technical knowledge could launch quickly using ready-made software by tech providers. Companies advertised heavily, had relaxed rules, and offered limited-time deals that attracted huge numbers of traders. The marketing focused on lifestyle and going viral on social medi a, not on the serious financial risks behind the scenes. The industry grew incredibly fast, but this growth wasn’t built to last. Stage 2: Problems Emerge (late-2023–2024) More firms entered the market, forcing everyone to lower prices and relax rules even further just to stay competitive. At the same time, some traders found loopholes to exploit, using tricks like taking advantage of data delays, copying successful traders’ moves, or abusing referral programs. This made it much harder for firms to protect themselves financially, and payouts became unpredictable. Firms realized that simply charging evaluation fees wasn’t enough to cover losses when things went wrong. Stage 3: Getting Serious About Risk (2025 and Beyond) The companies that survived are now rebuilding with a focus on financial stability. They’re setting aside bigger cash reserves, verifying trader identities to prevent fraud, creating clear legal agreements, monitoring trader behavior more carefully, and using advanced systems to manage their overall financial exposure in real-time. The goal: build sustainable, honest businesses that can reliably pay traders without relying on gimmicky promotions. The Current Problems in the Industry The prop firm industry experienced explosive growth but faced a major shakeout over the last two years. Here are the main challenges: Oversaturation and Mass Closures Between 80-100 prop firms shut down in 2024 alone, representing about 13-14% of all firms. Hundreds of firms had popped up in just a few years, but many lacked capital or sustainable business models. Competition drove unrealistic promises (“90% split! Million-dollar scaling!”). By the end of 2024, only 71 out of 82 tracked firms remained operational (86.6% survival rate). The MetaQuotes Crisis (2024) The biggest industry shock came in February 2024 when MetaQuotes, the company behind MetaTrader platforms, restricted support for prop firms: Many firms lost access to MT4/MT5 platforms overnight. Firms scrambled to migrate to alternative platforms (cTrader, TradeLocker, DXTrade, MatchTrader). MetaTrader’s market share among prop firms dropped from 48% to 24% within 9 months. Notable casualties included SurgeTrader, True Forex Funds, and MyForexFunds. Trust Erosion Traders are increasingly skeptical after seeing firms collapse or withhold payouts. Pass Rate Reality : Of the 14% who pass challenges, only about 45% achieve actual payouts ( 7% of all traders ). Bad actors continue to damage the reputation of the entire industry. Liquidity Crunches If too many traders request payouts at once, firms without strong financial backing can’t keep up. Several firms in 2024 closed due to liquidity issues within weeks or months of launching. This creates instability and sudden collapses. Lack of Regulation With minimal oversight, firms can shut down overnight without accountability. But change is coming : Nearly 70% of traders now support regulation ( PipFarm survey , January 2025). European regulators (ESMA, Italian Consob, Belgian FSMA) are actively investigating the industry. CFTC in the US is also increasing scrutiny. Potential Future #1: Industry Consolidation This is already happening. Current Reality: 80-100 small firms closed in 2024. Many firms were absorbed or acquired by larger players. Established firms with proven track records are gaining market share. Traditional regulated brokers (IC Markets, Eightcap, OANDA) are entering the space. What This Means: Traders are gravitating toward firms with years of proven payouts. Only well-capitalized, professionally-run firms will survive. The “Wild West” era is ending. Potential Future #2: Regulation Controversy exists around regulation: Prop firms are legal in many places but often unregulated, leading to debates on whether they resemble Ponzi schemes (payouts funded by losers’ fees) or genuine talent scouts. Regulation is no longer “potential” since it’s actively happening. Current Regulatory Status: Here’s the reailty : Most prop firms aren’t regulated like real financial companies. They give you demo or simulated accounts (fake money), not real accounts. Since you’re trading with fake money during challenges, governments treat them like video game companies, not financial institutions. That’s why they can operate without strict financial oversight…for now. Current Regulatory Developments: Europe: ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) conducted preliminary reviews of prop firms. Italian regulator Consob warned investors about prop trading “ video games “. Belgian FSMA raised concerns about courses designed to make traders fail repeatedly. Spanish CNMV issued similar warnings. United States : CFTC shut down MyForexFunds in 2023 for fraudulent practices. SEC expanded definitions of “dealers,” affecting some prop operations. Increasing pressure on firms to classify as either gaming platforms or financial services. Likely Future Regulations: Consumer Protection Rules : Firms may be required to disclose pass rates. Mandatory disclosure of business models (demo vs. live trading). Clear payout ratios and fee structures. Financial Oversight : Firms holding trader fees may need licenses or audits. Separation of payout funds from operating capital. Minimum capitalization requirements. Advertising Restrictions : Limits on “get rich quick” marketing. Required risk disclosures. Appropriateness tests are conducted before allowing traders to participate. Trader Rights : Clear rules against withholding payouts without a valid cause. Standardized challenge rules. Transparent dispute resolution processes. Industry Self-Regulation: The Prop Association (TPA) was formed in 2025 to establish industry standards. Goal : Transparency, accountability, and ethical operations. 👉 For traders , regulation could mean fewer scams and more protection, possibly higher fees, and stricter entry requirements. Potential Future #3: Hybrid Models Some firms are already experimenting with hybrid models: Education + Funding Firms require traders to complete training before funding. Ensures traders have baseline skills. Why mandatory education isn’t standard? Prop firms profit from challenge fees even when traders fail. Requiring education before challenges would reduce revenue by creating barriers to entry. The business model depends on volume: with 90-95% of traders failing, firms earn more by offering educational “support” while keeping the challenge pipeline flowing. Brokerage Integration Traditional regulated brokers are entering the prop space, with funded accounts tied directly to their infrastructure. IC Markets launched ICFunded in March 2024, offering $5,000-$500,000 accounts with challenge fees from $29.75 to $2,498. OANDA launched OANDA Prop Trader in January 2024 with $10,000-$500,000 accounts and up to 90% profit splits. Axi launched Axi Select, Hantec Markets launched Hantec Trader, and ATFX announced prop trading expansion in October 2024. While IC Markets and OANDA are regulated brokers , their prop trading divisions operate through offshore entities without direct prop firm regulation. IC Markets operates its prop division separately from its main regulated entities, while OANDA operates through the British Virgin Islands under its Global Markets division. Broker-backed firms offer more stability and transparency, but understand the regulatory structure. You’re still trading simulated capital through offshore entities. The broker’s reputation provides credibility , not regulatory protection. Subscription Models Some prop firms now offer monthly “seat fees” for access to capital, rather than one-time challenge payments. How Subscriptions Work: Instead of paying $500-$2,000 for ONE challenge attempt, you pay $49-$360 monthly for unlimited retries during that billing cycle. The Process: Choose your account size ($10,000-$300,000 range) Pay first month’s fee (auto-renews unless you cancel) Start your evaluation immediately If you fail, automatically retry with a fresh account Stop paying once you get funded Why This Creates More Predictable Revenue for Firms: Subscription models provide consistent income streams for prop firms, regardless of market conditions or trader performance. A firm with 5,000 subscribers at $150/month generates $750,000 in predictable monthly revenue, plus reset fees, activation fees, and profit splits from successful traders. Why It’s a Lower Barrier to Entry for Traders: Let’s compare the costs: Traditional : Pay $500 → fail → pay $500 again → fail → spent $1,000 with no funding Subscription : Month 1 ($99) → retry Month 2 ($99) → retry Month 3 ($99) → pass Month 4 ($99) → Total: $396 for four attempts The psychology matters to “just $49 to try” creates less pressure than “I paid $500 and can’t afford to fail.” Real Examples with Pricing: Topstep : $50K account: $49/month $100K account: $99/month $150K account: $149/month Bulenox charges $115-$535 monthly during evaluation (based on account size). Once funded, monthly fees end, though you’ll then pay data feed fees (~$130/month) and commissions. BluSky Trading , Apex Trader Funding , My Funded Futures , Take Profit Trader , and Elite Trader Funding all use this model. Industry Adoption: 80-90% of futures prop firms now use subscription models (industry standard), while 30-40% of forex firms have adopted this approach, with traditional one-time fees still dominating forex/crypto prop trading. Subscription models reduce upfront risk and allow gradual learning. Just remember to manually cancel to avoid ongoing charges. Subscriptions auto-renew, and firms typically offer no refunds once a billing cycle starts. Instant Funding Models Some firms now offer immediate funding without challenges with higher fees, but faster access to capital. How Instant Funding Works: You eliminate evaluation phases entirely. Select your account size, pay a one-time fee (typically 3-10x higher than equivalent challenges), and receive login credentials within hours to start trading immediately. The Complete Process: Choose from $625-$200,000 account tiers Pay one-time fee ($44-$5,000 depending on size) Receive credentials the same day Begin trading immediately. No profit targets, minimum days, or evaluation phases Request payouts bi-weekly or weekly A $10,000 challenge typically costs $80-150, while instant funding costs $400-450, roughly 3-5x more expensive . You’re paying a premium to skip 4-12 weeks of evaluation. Why Instant Funding is Popular Among Experienced Traders: Time is money for proven traders. Someone with a profitable strategy validated over 6-12 months sees little value in spending another 4-12 weeks proving themselves through artificial challenge requirements. If you’re still learning technical analysis basics or consistently blow demo accounts, instant funding’s higher costs and lack of evaluation structure make it a poor choice. This model suits traders with 6-12 months of consistent live trading, proven drawdown management, and documented profitable strategies. Will These Hybrids Become the Standard? The short answer: Some already are, others are emerging. Education + Funding: NOT standard as a mandatory prerequisite. Challenge-based evaluations remain dominant (90%+ of firms), with education offered as optional support rather than a required gateway. Brokerage Integration: IC Markets, OANDA, Axi, Hantec Markets, and ATFX confirm that regulated brokers view prop trading as a strategic opportunity. Expect more major broker launches in the future. Subscription Models: Established standard in futures (80-90% adoption), growing in forex/crypto (30-40% adoption). This is mature rather than emerging, particularly for US-based futures trading. Instant Funding: Rapidly becoming standard. Expect more firms to offer this. Dozens of recent launches confirm this transition from novelty to mainstream expectation. These hybrid models represent genuine innovation in how traders access funding, offering unprecedented choice in fee structures, evaluation approaches, and institutional backing. As the industry matures, look for firms to offer multiple pathways: traditional challenges, subscriptions, and instant funding, allowing traders to choose based on their experience level, budget, and timeline. More options exist than ever, but the core challenge remains
