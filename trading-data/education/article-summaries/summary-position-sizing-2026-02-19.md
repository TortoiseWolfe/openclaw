## Key Concepts

After journeying across the globe with Newbie Ned and through some basic position sizing examples, you’re well on your way to becoming a competent risk manager. Now knowing how to set the correct position sizes is only a part of what it takes to become a pro at risk management. The other part is discipline . Stick to your stops and pre-determined risk comfort levels, and you’ll be sure to have enough after your losses to take advantage of future profitable opportunities. Position Sizing Calculator Risk management is not optional . It is the foundation of consistent trading success. One of the biggest mistakes new traders make is guessing how big their trade should be. That is exactly what position sizing solves. Position sizing tells you how many units to trade so you only risk what you intentionally decided to risk, no more and no less. We know that you won’t always have a calculator handy or a position sizing feature included with your trading platform, so we, here at BabyPips.com, have decided to take it upon ourselves and have built a handy-dandy position sizing calculator for you! Bam! Aren’t we cool? Use the forex position size calculator if you need it! Actually, you should use the position size calculator before every single trade you place. Doing this helps you trade with discipline instead of emotion. What the Position Size Calculator Helps You Do The calculator allows you to determine the correct trade size based on: Your account balance The percentage of your account you want to risk Your stop loss distance in pips The currency pair you are trading By combining these inputs, the calculator gives you the exact position size that keeps your risk within your predefined limits. Why This Matters Using the position size calculator consistently helps you: •Avoid risking too much on a single trade Prevent accidental over leverage Stay consistent even after wins or losses Remove guesswork and emotion from trade sizing Many traders focus heavily on entries and exits but ignore position sizing. In reality, position sizing often matters more than your entry because it determines whether a losing trade is survivable. How It Works Conceptually Behind the scenes, the calculator is simply automating a basic risk formula: You decide how much of your account you are willing to lose if the trade fails. You define where your stop loss is placed. The calculator then adjusts your position size so that if the stop loss is hit, your loss matches your planned risk. This ensures that every trade carries a similar level of risk, regardless of how wide or tight your stop loss is. Bottom Line Use the Position Size Calculator first. Then place the trade. As the old saying goes, better to be safe than sorry.
