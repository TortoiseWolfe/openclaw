## Key Concepts

Forex, a portmanteau of foreign and exchange, is where banks, businesses, governments, investors, and individuals buy or sell currencies. Whenever you purchase something in another currency or exchange cash to get the local money of your vacation destination, you’re taking part in the forex or foreign exchange (FX) market . Businesses and individuals often do this while investors trade currencies to profit from fluctuating exchange rates . Forex is the largest and most liquid market in the world. Participants in this global electronic marketplace traded about $7.5 trillion per day in 2022, far exceeding the daily trading volumes of the world stock market.

There is no single centralized exchange like there is with stocks. Transactions are made over computer networks that connect traders all over the world. Currencies move among traders, often with the support of a broker. Since it's done electronically, there is typically no physical exchange of actual currencies. The main markets are open 24 hours a day, five days a week, beginning Sunday at 5 p.m. ET and ending Friday at 5 p.m. ET. What happens during these sessions determines the value of the world’s currencies or how much of x currency will buy how much of y currency. Currency prices, or exchange rates, are determined by supply and demand , or, more specifically, the demand for one currency compared with another. The factors that affect demand for a currency include a country's economic growth, inflation, interest rates set by central banks, and political stability. The chart above includes information on the size of different types of forex markets. In the past, big companies, governments, and hedge funds dominated the foreign exchange market. Today, currency trading is much easier for retail investors. Here are the major players in the market: In the forex market, currencies are traded in pairs . That means when you buy one currency you are simultaneously selling another one—and vice versa. For each currency pair, there is an exchange rate, indicating how much of the quote currency is needed to buy one unit of the base currency . For example, one of the most popular currency pairs is EUR/USD , which is short for the euro and U.S. dollar. If the exchange rate for this currency pair is 1.10, it means one euro can be exchanged for 1.10 U.S. dollars. XE.com is one of the most popular places to obtain live exchange rates. If you use its platform, you’ll be given the option to input an amount in a selected currency and convert it to another currency at the current exchange rate. How you trade forex depends a lot on your familiarity with currencies and trading. Here’s how a beginner can get started in steps: Let’s say you think the U.S. dollar will strengthen in value against the euro. Suppose the USD/EUR is trading at 0.90, meaning one U.S. dollar is worth 0.90 euros, and you think it could soon reach parity, meaning one U.S. dollar would buy one euro. Your rationale is based on studying recent moves in the market and EU-American trade discussions over tariffs . Based on this conviction, you exchange 900 euros for $1,000. Later, the exchange rate changes to 0.98, meaning one dollar now buys 0.98 euros. If you were to cash in at that moment and exit the trade, you would walk away with 980 euros, minus fees, representing an $80 profit. Let’s assume you stayed in the trade, and the tables turned. After a few more weeks, the euro surged against the dollar, pushing the exchange rate all the way down to 0.85. Now, your original 900 euros would be worth 850 euros, which is a loss, even without factoring in trading fees. Like any investing market, forex trading offers both risks and benefits. Some of the biggest draws are its long opening hours, high liquidity, and all-around accessibility. With forex trading, it’s possible to invest even small amounts and use leverage (borrow to augment your trades), and transaction costs are generally low. Risks include how easy it is to use leverage and engage in complex trades in a market known for its volatility. The fact the forex market is decentralized, with no central exchange guaranteeing a trade, adds to this danger. Forex offers a lot more flexibility. But that comes at the cost of less regulation. The forex market is used not just to exchange currencies but also to speculate on their future directions, including through futures and options contracts and by using leverage. Today, many retail investors trade through online brokers . The forex market is known for its accessibility, with low fees, high liquidity, and low minimum investment requirements. However, it's also extremely volatile and can be risky for novices and experts alike.
