## Key Concepts

The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers . As a momentum indicator , the RSI compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices drop. Comparing this result to price movement can help traders predict how a security might perform in the future. Traders can make better trading decisions when they use the RSI with other technical indicators . The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula: R S I step one = 100 − [ 100 1 + Average gain Average loss ] RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right] RS I step one ​ = 100 − [ 1 + Average loss Average gain ​ 100 ​ ] The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss. The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%. The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation: 55.55 = 100 − [ 100 1 + ( 1 % 14 ) ( 0.8 % 14 ) ] 55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ] 55.55 = 100 − ​ 1 + ( 14 0.8% ​ ) ( 14 1% ​ ) ​ 100 ​ ​ Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market . R S I step two = 100 − [ 100 1 + ( Previous Average Gain × 13 ) + Current Gain ( ( Previous Average Loss × 13 ) + Current Loss ) ] RSI_{\text{step two}} = 100 - \left [ \frac{ 100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \text{Previous Average Gain} \times 13 \right ) \ + \ \text{Current Gain} }{ \left ( \left ( \text{Previous Average Loss} \times 13 \right ) \ + \ \text{Current Loss} \right ) } } \right ] RS I step two ​ = 100 − [ 1 + ( ( Previous Average Loss × 13 ) + Current Loss ) ( Previous Average Gain × 13 ) + Current Gain ​ 100 ​ ] After the RSI is calculated, the RSI indicator can be plotted, usually beneath an asset’s price chart, as shown below. The RSI will rise as the number and size of up days increase. It will fall as the number and size of down days increase. As you can see in the above chart, the RSI indicator can stay in the overbought region for extended periods while the stock is in an uptrend . The indicator may also remain in oversold territory for a long time when the stock is in a downtrend . This can be confusing for new analysts, but learning to use the indicator within the context of the prevailing trend will clarify these issues. The primary trend of the security is important to know to understand RSI readings properly. For example, well-known market technician Constance Brown, CMT, proposed that an oversold reading by the RSI in an uptrend is probably much higher than 30. An overbought reading during a downtrend is also much lower than 70. As you can see in the following chart, during a downtrend, the RSI peaks near 50 rather than 70. This could be seen by traders as more reliably signaling bearish conditions. Many investors draw horizontal trendlines at 30 and 70 during strong trends to better spot the overall trend and extreme levels. On the other hand, modifying overbought or oversold RSI levels when the price of a stock or asset is in a long-term horizontal channel or trading range (rather than a strong upward or downward trend) is usually unnecessary. The relative strength indicator isn't as reliable in trending markets as it is in trading ranges. In fact, most traders understand that the signals given by the RSI in strong upward or downward trends often can be false. A related concept focuses on trade signals and techniques that conform to the trend. In other words, using bullish signals primarily when the price is in a bullish trend and bearish signals primarily when a stock is in a bearish trend may help traders avoid the false alarms that the RSI can generate in trending markets. A number of RSI levels can be considered bullish, depending on whether the market is trending up or down or is rangebound. One bullish signal is when the RSI crosses below 30, where it would be considered oversold . But as noted above, bullish RSI signals are best used in uptrends. In a strong downtrend, prices can keep falling even after indicators are oversold, so trades based on that signal may have limited upside and go against the main trend. Following a strong uptrend, another bullish RSI signal is a reversal after a decline to around 40 to 50, an area considered support during an uptrend. This often confirms a positive momentum shift back toward the uptrend after a pullback, signaling potential for continued gains. Bearish signals from the RSI appear much like bullish ones but in reverse. A basic bearish signal is when the RSI crosses above 70, an overbought level. If this is followed by a move below 70, upward momentum may weaken, alerting traders to a potential price reversal. But bearish RSI signals are best used in downtrends. During a strong downtrend, a bearish RSI signal is a reversal after a rise to around 50 to 60. This often confirms a momentum shift back toward the downside after a pullback, signaling potential for continued declines. During trends , the RSI readings may fall into a band or range. During a strong uptrend , the RSI tends to stay well above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a strong downtrend , it's rare to see the RSI exceed 70, while it frequently hits 30 or below. These guidelines can help traders determine trend strength and spot potential reversals. For example, if the RSI can’t reach 70 on a number of consecutive price swings during an uptrend, but then drops below 30, the trend is likely breaking down. The opposite is true for a downtrend. If the downtrend is unable to reach 30 or below and then rallies above 70, that downtrend has broken down and could be reversing to the upside. Trendlines and moving averages are helpful technical tools to include when using the RSI in this way. Don't confuse RSI and relative strength. The former refers to changes in the price momentum of one security, while the latter compares the price performance of two or more securities. An RSI divergence happens when the indicator and price reach different levels, indicating a change in momentum that precedes a change in price direction. For example, a bullish divergence occurs when the security makes a lower low, but the indicator forms a higher low. This indicates rising bullish momentum and could be used to trigger a new long position . A bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a higher high, but the RSI makes a lower high. This indicates a possible shift to downside momentum. As you can see in the following chart, a bullish divergence was identified when the RSI formed a series of higher lows as the price formed lower lows. This was a valid signal, but divergences can be misleading when a stock is in a stable long-term trend. In that case, numerous divergences can be seen before a reversal occurs. Using flexible oversold or overbought readings will help identify more potential signals. An additional price-RSI relationship that traders watch for is positive and negative RSI reversals. These are the opposite of bearish and bullish divergences. A positive RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a lower low at the same time a security's price reaches a higher low. Traders would consider this formation a bullish sign and a buy signal. Conversely, a negative RSI reversal may occur once the RSI exceeds its previous high at the same time that a security's price reaches a lower high. This formation would be a bearish sign and a sell signal. Another trading technique examines RSI behavior when it's reemerging from overbought or oversold territory. This signal is called a swing rejection. A bullish swing rejection has four parts: As you can see in the following chart, the RSI indicator was oversold, broke up through 30, and formed the rejection low that triggered the signal when it bounced higher. Using the RSI in this way is very similar to drawing trendlines on a price chart. There is a bearish version of the swing rejection signal that's a mirror image of the bullish version. A bearish swing rejection also has four parts: The following chart illustrates the bearish swing rejection signal. As with most trading techniques, this signal will be most reliable when it conforms to the prevailing long-term trend. Bearish signals during downward trends are less likely to generate false alarms. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is another trend-following momentum indicator that shows how two moving averages of a security’s price are related. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD line. It can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell, or short, the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line. The RSI was designed to indicate whether a security is overbought or oversold in relation to recent price levels. It's calculated using average price gains and losses over a given period of time. The default time period is 14 periods, with values bounded from 0 to 100. The MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs, while the RSI measures price change momentum in relation to recent price highs and lows. These two indicators are often used together to provide analysts with a more complete technical picture of a market. Both indicators measure the momentum of an asset. However, they measure different factors and may sometimes give contradictory indications. For example, the RSI may show a reading above 70 for a sustained period of time, indicating a security is overextended on the buy side. At the same time, the MACD
