## Key Concepts

At this point, you’ve learned what a prop firm is (Lesson 1) and the myths vs. realities (Lesson 2). But there’s still a missing piece: How do prop firms actually make money? 💰 This is important because once you understand the business model , you’ll see: Why prop firms set certain rules. Why so many traders fail. Why firms don’t “need” you to succeed to be profitable. Understanding how retail prop firms make money reveals their incentives…and those incentives often conflict with yours . You stop seeing the firms’ rules as just helpful guidelines and start seeing them as a carefully designed business model. Prop Firms Sell Access , Not Capital Here’s the big secret: Traditional prop firms make money directly from trading profits. Retail prop firms make money primarily by selling access to trading opportunities. They don’t hand you real cash and hope you grow it. Instead, they sell you a challenge, which is a test with strict rules. Once you click “BUY,” whether you pass or fail, they’ve already been paid. This difference changes everything. One is a job. The other is a product you’re buying. The Evaluation or “Challenge” Funnel: Where Most Money Is Made The prop firm business model operates as a multi-step funnel. Here’s how the economics work at each step. Step 1: The Challenge Trader pays $100–$1,000+ for access to a simulated account (often $10k–$200k). Example: $500 fee for a $100,000 challenge. Step 2: Attempting the Challenge Trader tries to hit an 8–10% profit target while respecting strict risk rules. Some firms require passing just one challenge; others require two consecutive stages (e.g., 10% then 5%). The vast majority fail at some point in the process. Industry estimates suggest 85-95% , though firms rarely disclose official pass rates. The firm keeps the fee regardless of the outcome. Step 3: Retrying (“Resets”) If a trader fails a challenge (usually by not meeting profit targets or by breaking risk rules), the prop firm often allows them to “reset” and start over from scratch, usually for a fee or by buying another challenge. Resets wipe out your previous trades and restart your progress toward passing the challenge.​ Some firms call this “retrying” or “second chance,” and you can pay for as many resets as you want. This is a common practice: traders buy multiple challenges or resets until they successfully pass and get a funded account. Some traders spend thousands over time, even without ever passing. Step 4: The Funded Stage A small percentage pass and move to “funded” accounts. Even here, many lose the account quickly, forcing them to restart. At each step, the firm earns more than it loses. The system is designed like a slot machine: pay to play, most lose, some win, but the house always profits. Revenue Stream #1: Challenge and Evaluation Fees This is the core of the business. Firms advertise “$100,000 accounts for $500.” In reality, they’re selling you the chance to prove yourself under strict rules. Most fail, making the challenge fee essentially a revenue product. If 10,000 traders pay $500 each: The firm collects $5,000,000 upfront. If only 5% pass, the firm refunds ~$250,000. Even if they paid out $50,000 to a handful of winners, they’re still profitable (assuming diligent management of operational costs). 🔑 Key point: The model works even if nobody is profitable long-term. Revenue Stream #2: Add-Ons and Resets If the firm profits whether you succeed or fail, then their incentive isn’t to help you win, it’s to keep you TRYING. Failed your evaluation on day 29? No problem! Just pay $299 to reset and try again. Need three more days to hit your profit target? That’s another $79. Want to “scale up” to a $200,000 account after proving yourself? Fork over another $1,000. Prop firms make serious money from these add-ons: Reset fees (restart after failing) Extensions (buy more time) Scaling packages (upgrade to bigger account sizes) Here’s why these are so profitable: they exploit the exact moment when traders are most emotionally vulnerable. You just failed after 28 days of discipline? Fear of “wasting” that progress makes the reset fee feel necessary. You’ve already paid $500 for the evaluation? Sunk cost fallacy whispers: “ Just one more try… “ You came this close to passing? Hope says, “ Next time will be different. “ The firm knows this. That’s why the reset button is one click away, and why the “limited time offer” countdown timer is always ticking. That’s also why the “special offer” email lands in your inbox the day after you fail. You’re not their investment. You’re their revenue stream. Revenue Stream #3: Platform Partnerships and Data Many prop firms partner with tech providers , as well as brokers or liquidity providers . These partnerships can generate additional revenue through: Licensing fees. Data-sharing agreements. Commissions on trading volume. This is why some firms encourage active trading. The more trades you place, the more the firm earns. Also, the more data that is generated. In some cases, firms may even profit from the trading data itself (by selling order flow insights). When many traders buy and sell through a prop firm’s platform, the firm collects data showing what kinds of trades are being made, when, and in what volume. That data can be valuable to other financial companies (like brokers, hedge funds, or market makers) who want to understand market behavior. So, the prop firm might sell summaries or insights from that trading data, known as “order flow” to those companies. Basically, the firm can earn money by selling information about trading patterns, even if the traders themselves aren’t making profits. Revenue Stream #4: Actual Trading Profits (Secondary) Do prop firms ever make money from actual trading ? Yes. But here’s the reality: it’s a rounding error compared to evaluation fees. Here’s how it works when a trader actually succeeds: The firm copies (“mirrors”) the trader’s positions into live markets with real capital. When the trader wins, the firm captures those profits. The trader gets their cut (usually 80%), and the firm keeps the rest (20%). Sounds great, right? Except there’s a problem: most traders never get here. If 95% of traders fail the evaluation, that means only 5% ever reach the point where the firm is trading real money. And of that 5%, many blow their funded accounts within weeks. Evaluation fees are the business model . Trading profits are the marketing story . For example, a prop firm makes $500 from every trader who fails. They make $20-50 per winning trade from the rare trader who succeeds. Which would you rather build a business on? That’s why most prop firms need a constant stream of new traders paying evaluation fees. The trading profits? That’s just a nice bonus when it happens. So do firms ever actually profit from trader performance? Yes…But it’s secondary. Some firms mirror successful trader accounts into live markets. This allows them to capture real profits when traders win. But because so few traders succeed, this is not the main revenue driver. Instead, it’s a bonus, like icing on the cake, built on challenge fees. Why the Business Model Incentivizes Strict Rules From a business standpoint, the rules make perfect sense. Daily drawdowns, profit targets, time limits….they’re not random. They’re designed to make most traders fail before the firm ever has to risk real payouts. For example: If you must hit 8% in 30 days but can’t lose more than 5% in a single day, you’re forced onto a tightrope. This is unrealistic even for most professional trading. This constraint forces reckless risk-taking. Many traders overtrade to meet deadlines, increasing failure rates. This keeps the revenue flowing in from retries without overwhelming the firm with payouts. Sustainability Issues If too many traders succeed and require large payouts, the firm can struggle financially because most retail prop firms’ revenues come from evaluation/challenge fees. Because the model depends on fees, sustainability as a business can be tricky: Too many winners → Firm struggles to pay out. Too few winners → Traders lose trust and stop signing up. Regulatory pressure → More oversight could reduce profit margins. This imbalance and dependency on a steady flow of new evaluation fee payers partly explain why some retail prop firms suddenly collapse: if the inflow of fees and the outflow of payouts cannot be balanced, solvency issues arise. This is why some firms collapse overnight: they can’t balance payouts with new sign-ups. Why Some Prop Firms Succeed and Others Fail The long-term success or failure of a prop trading firm is largely determined by its reputation for fairness, transparency, and reliability within the trading community. 💪 The strongest firms: Balance marketing with payouts. Have transparent rules and a history of paying on time. Build trust to keep attracting new traders. Reputable prop firms have clear payout schedules and honor withdrawal requests promptly, which helps build long-term trust with traders. These firms maintain transparent rules, documented histories of timely payments, and foster loyalty from traders who recommend them to others. 🪦 The weakest firms: Over-promise, under-deliver. Refuse or delay payouts. Collapse when negative reviews spread. Many retail prop firms are run with thin capital buffers precisely because the main product is the challenge fee, not real market profits generated by traders. Firms that fail often over-promise with unrealistic advertising, do not pay traders or delay payouts with hidden rules or last-minute “reviews,” and ultimately lose trust in the trading community. When dissatisfied traders share negative experiences online, these firms can quickly collapse as reputation is a critical factor in attracting new traders to their programs. The Trader’s Role in This Model For the firm, traders are not employees. They are customers. Most traders sign up thinking they’re entering a partnership, like the firm is giving them a shot at the big leagues. But look at the actual transaction: You pay the firm (they don’t pay you) You take the risk (they set the rules) Your money funds their operations (not your trading account) If the firm were truly investing in you , they’d pay you to take the evaluation, not the other way around. Can you still succeed? Absolutely. Some traders pass evaluations, get funded, and make real money. But you need to go in with eyes wide open: this is a business transaction , not a partnership. The firm isn’t betting on you… you’re betting on yourself, and paying them for the privilege of trying. Ask yourself: “If I paid this $500 to a trading course or a mentor instead, would I get better odds of success?” Sometimes the answer is yes to prop firms. But make it a choice , not a fantasy . What You’re Really Paying For: “Drawdown Capital” Trading with “big capital” is an ILLUSION. When you pay a fee to a prop firm (let’s say $500) for $100,000 account with a 10% drawdown limit, you’re not buying an account with $100,000 of free money to trade with. Instead, you’re paying for the right to lose up to $10,000 (10% of $100,000) before you get stopped out. Think of it like this: the firm is giving you room to make mistakes, that’s the “ drawdown capital. ” If you lose tha t $10,000 , you’re done. 💀 The firm isn’t handing you $100,000 in “trading capital,” they’re setting a LIMIT on how much you can lose while trying to prove you can trade profitably. And only after you make money beyond that drawdown limit do you actually start earning payouts. From the prop firm’s side: They aren’t exposing $100,000 per trader. They’re managing aggregate risk across thousands of accounts. Most traders lose and never reach payout. That’s where the firm’s profit comes from. What this means for you: The “$100,000 account” is really a risk management framework , not a pile of cash. You’re paying the entry fee to prove you can trade profitably within tight constraints. Before paying any prop firm fee, ask yourself: Can I consistently make
