## Key Concepts

When trading forex, where are you actually trading? In the previous lesson, you learned that retail forex traders do NOT trade in the “real” FX market . If that’s the case, then WHERE are you actually trading? When you click “Buy” or “Sell” on your forex broker’s trading platform, where do your orders go? 🤔 That’s what we’ll reveal in this lesson. In order to understand where your trades go, we first need to understand where retail forex brokers and traders (like yourself) fit within the FX market ecosystem. The FX market is fragmented and complex but we’ll try and provide a simplified and stylized overview. Let’s pretend there is a giant body of water…a gigantic lake . A lake that’s bigger than an ocean. The gigantiest lake ever. Let’s say this giant lake represents the “ FX market ”. This giant lake is not empty. It contains boats ! The boats come in different sizes. These boats represent the market participants in the FX market. Imagine there are thousands of these boats in the water. These market participants tend to be banks, non-bank financial institutions (“NBFIs”), multinational corporations (“MNCs”), large institutional investors, algorithmic trading firms such as high-frequency trading (“HFTs”) and electronic market makers, hedge funds, and high-net-worth individuals (“HNWIs”). Some are huge. Some are less huge. The huge boats are the large commercial banks. Banks like Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, and UBS. Their boats are huge since they have a lot of capital. The big boats sometimes trade directly with each other. This is known as a “ bilateral trade ”. So you can say that two boats can “ trade bilaterally ”. When these big boats trade bilaterally, only the two market participants involved know what the quotes given were and the actual price that was agreed upon. Other market participants (boats) do not have access to this information at all. Banks provide different quotes to different customers and agreed-upon prices and volumes are often never publicly disclosed. That makes it harder for any market participant to know if their trade was at a good (or bad) price. But there aren’t only boats on this giant lake. There are lots of islands ! These islands represent the different trading venues in the FX market. The rise of electronic trading in FX resulted in an explosion of trading platforms and electronic execution venues . These platforms are known as interdealer (IDP), single-dealer (SDP), multi-dealer (MDP) platforms. However, with the rise of venues such as electronic communication networks (ECNs), application programming interfaces (APIs), and API aggregators, the distinction among these traditional segments has started to blur together and become less clear. In general, trading venues are where different market participants can come together and trade with each other. When trading on one of these islands (trading venues), market participants must abide by the island’s rules. The island runs a marketplace that facilitates trades between market participants. Some even provide anonymous trading where you can submit orders without revealing your identity to the other traders. For example, if a buyer wants to buy 10 million units of USD/JPY at 110.00 and a seller wants to sell 10 million units of USD/JPY at 110.00, the orders are matched up. All without revealing the identity of either buyer or seller. As you can see, there is not one single island where ALL trading takes place. And prices that traders buy and sell are unique to each island. For example, if a ship were to “island hop”, it might find on one island, the ask price for USDJPY is 110.00, while on another island, the ask price is 110.01. The FX market is fragmented, meaning the USD/JPY market on one trading venue is separate from other trading venues. Each currency pair will have its own price, liquidity, and trading volume depending on the venue. FX trading occurs in many different places all at once . So there really isn’t a single “FX Market”. It’s a bunch of different markets that comprise the “FX Market”. If you think about it, the “FX Market” is really a NETWORK of a bunch of different places to trade, rather than a single place. Islands differ in size. The size represents the amount of trading volume that occurs on an island. Different boats trade on different islands. While some boats are rich enough to be able to trade on any island, most aren’t. Depending on the island, only certain boats are allowed. For example, there are boats that are so rich, that they actually own their very own island! If a boat owns an island, no other large boats (banks) are allowed. Only special, smaller boats (clients of the bank) are allowed. These types of islands are known as “single-dealer platforms (SDPs)”. Examples of SDPs and its owners are Autobahn (Deutsche Bank), BARX (Barclays), Cortex (BNP Paribas), Neo (UBS), and Velocity (Citi). Which is fine by most of the large boats, since they also own their very own exclusive island anyway. Another example, the two big islands in the middle, only the biggest boats are allowed to trade there . The people who trade on these big boats are called dealers . So on these islands, dealers trade with each other in large quantities. This is known as the “ interdealer market ”. The prefix “ inter ” means “between” or “among”. The interdealer market is also known as the “ interbank market ” since most dealers work for large multinational commercial banks that serve global clients. These huge banks are also known as “ bulge bracket ” banks. The “islands” in the interdealer market are known as “ interdealer platforms ” (IDPs). which are electronic trading platforms where non-disclosed (anonymous) trading occurs in the interdealer market. Examples of IDPs are EBS Market and Refinitiv Matching. The interdealer segment of the FX market is where trades occur between FX dealers , as opposed to between dealers and their end customers, such as exporters and importers, asset managers, hedge funds, and even some retail forex brokers. In the past, only the biggest of boats were allowed on these big islands. This is because large boats preferred to only trade with other large boats. They deemed smaller boats as too risky to trade with. But nowadays, it’s possible for medium-sized boats to trade there as well by “attaching” themselves to one of the large boats. We won’t get into the details right now to keep things simple but basically, the large boat (bank) allows the medium boat (hedge fund) to trade in its name. This is how the medium boats are able to access these big islands and trade with the other large boats. In exchange for the privilege to trade in its name, the large boat typically charges the medium boat a fee based on the volume of trades done. This arrangement is known as a “ prime brokerage ” arrangement, with the large boat in the role called a “ prime broker ” (or “ PB ”) and the medium boat in the role as the prime broker’s client . Prime brokers make it possible for these smaller (but not too small) market participants, despite their limited credit history or higher risk profile, to use the prime broker’s higher credit rating, and trade almost anywhere and with anyone in the “lake”. Basically, the clear distinction that separated the interdealer market and the rest of the market in the past has now become blurred. The important thing to know about the interdealer market is that it is a global network (of trading venues) used by banks and large non-bank financial institutions (“NBFIs”) to trade currencies between themselves. Trades occur electronically or via voice . This “market” operates in a highly decentralized fashion as a loose network where banks and NBFIs negotiate bilateral deals without central supervision. This supposed “market” is, in reality, a network. So when you see the term “interdealer market” or “interbank market”, it simply refers to a network where currency transactions are negotiated between financial institutions and other large companies. The rates that are traded in the interdealer market then spread (like gossip) to the other boats and smaller islands (the rest of the FX market) and are used as “reference” rates by other market participants. These rates are what’s (hopefully) displayed to you by your retail forex broker. Usually with a markup. Now that we’re discussing retail forex brokers, let’s see where they fit in the picture. A retail forex broker is one of the tiny boats. Of course, since some retail forex brokers are larger than others, their boats also come in different sizes. There are large retail forex brokers. And there are smaller ones. Retail forex brokers can’t trade directly with other boats. In order to trade, a retail forex broker needs to “attach” themselves to a larger boat that will allow it to trade in its name. This special type of relationship is known as a prime broker (“PB”) relationship . The large boat becomes the retail forex broker’s PB. A PB is an entity that is willing to represent the retail forex broker in all its trading transactions that occur in the lake and settle the trades in its name. But large boats are picky. For the larger retail forex brokers, they’re able to enter into a prime broker (“PB”) relationship with a large boat. For the smaller brokers, they’re considered too risky for the large boats. They do not meet the rigid standards and are not able to secure a prime broker relationship, which prevents them from being able to trade with others in the FX market. Fortunately, there are special types of boats that have an existing prime broker relationship with a large boat and offer a service to these smaller brokers that allows them to “piggyback” off this relationship. This special type of medium-sized boat is known as a “ Prime of Prime ” or “ PoP ”. Prime of Prime (PoP) refers to a firm that has an account with a Prime Broker (PB) that offers its services to other market participants such as forex brokers. PoPs bridge the gap between the institutional and retail FX markets by enabling retail forex brokers to leverage the PoP’s credit relationships with its PBs. The PoP allows the smaller retail broker to trade through it. Another way for smaller retail forex brokers to be able to trade with the “big boys” is to “ piggyback” off a larger retail forex broker who has an existing PB relationship. So if a retail forex broker is one of the tiny boats (more like rowboats and kayaks), where do you, the retail forex trader, fit in this picture ? You don’t. Huh? “Aren’t I a boat?” you might ask. Nope. As you just saw, it’s already difficult enough for retail forex brokers themselves to get access to the FX market. If other ships already deem them too risky to trade with them directly without some sort of chaperone (PB or PoP), why would they want to deal with individual retail forex traders ? “So if I’m not a boat, what am I?” you might then ask. A retail forex trader is NOT a boat Your retail forex broker is a boat. But… YOU are in an aquarium on their boat. Retail forex traders do not trade in the “market”. Your broker creates its own market for you to trade in. You trade with, and ONLY with, your forex broker . When you enter an order, it is your broker who takes it. An “order” is an instruction to buy or to sell as placed by you via your account on your broker’s trading platform. As a retail forex trader, when you enter an order to buy or sell a currency pair, the forex broker IS the counterparty to this trade . This is true for EVERY retail forex broker. You can confirm this, by reading the “Customer Agreement” document
