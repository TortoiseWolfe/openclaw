## Key Concepts

Some forex traders live and die by technical indicators while others couldn’t care less about them. Some rely heavily on their own fundamental or technical analysis while some like to let robots do the thinking. This test is designed to help you determine whether your personality suits discretionary , hybrid or mechanical (automated) trading. Take the results with a grain of salt. The results you get are just recommendations based on your answers and are meant to get you onto the right path. As you get better, keep an open mind to all new experiences and realities to help you evolve and grow your trading abilities.
