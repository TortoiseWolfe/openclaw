## Key Concepts

A symmetrical triangle pattern, also known as a coil, appears on trading charts when two converging trend lines connect sequential peaks and troughs. These lines, with opposing slopes, form a triangle shape, indicating a pause in the prevailing trend. This pattern often signals the start of a new trend or the continuation of an existing one, based on the breakout direction. Traders watch these patterns closely for profitable trading opportunities. Symmetrical triangles show a market pause, where bulls and bears are in balance. However, once the price breaks out decisively from the triangle, it often signals the start of a new trend or continuation of the prior trend. The direction of the breakout, whether above the upper trend line or below the lower trend line, tells you which side has gained the upper hand. Traders and analysts monitor symmetrical triangles for potential trades, guided by breakout direction and trade volume. Technical analysis using this chart pattern should confirm its validity with additional indicators. A symmetrical triangle chart pattern is a period of consolidation before the price is forced to break out or down. A breakdown from the lower trend line marks the start of a new bearish trend, while a breakout from the upper trend line indicates the beginning of a new bullish trend. The price target for a breakout or breakdown from a symmetrical triangle is equal to the distance from the high and low of the earliest part of the pattern applied to the breakout price point. For example, a symmetrical triangle pattern might start at a low of $10 and increase to $15 before the price range narrows over time. A breakout from $12 would imply a price target of $17 ($15 minus $10 equals $5, then plus $12 equals $17). The stop-loss for the symmetrical triangle pattern is often put right below the breakout point. For example, if the security breaks out from $12 with high trading volume, traders will frequently place a stop-loss just below $12. Symmetrical triangles differ from ascending and descending triangles in that the upper and lower trend lines slope toward a center point. In contrast, ascending triangles have a horizontal upper trend line, predicting a potential breakout higher, and descending triangles have a horizontal lower trend line, predicting a potential breakdown lower. Symmetrical triangles are like pennants and flags since these chart patterns can signal a continuation in price trends. However, flags and pennants require a sudden shift before they form. Symmetrical triangles can take shape without such a prior movement. Below are some differences between them. Structure and appearance : Formed when the price of an asset produces two converging trend lines with similar slopes, one connecting lower highs and the other connecting higher lows. Volume patterns : Tend to decrease gradually as the pattern develops, reflecting the market's uncertainty and the decrease in trading until a breakout occurs. Implications and outcomes : Suggest a period of consolidation where the market is undecided. The breakout direction is generally uncertain until it happens, although it continues in the direction of the trend preceding the pattern. Structure and appearance : are small and typically form after a sharp movement in price, resembling a small symmetrical triangle. However, pennants have a much short and narrower appearance, with trend lines that meet after a few price bars. Volume patterns : Typically a sharp decline in volume during its formation, followed by a significant increase in the breakout. This volume pattern underscores the consolidation phase after a rapid price change and anticipates the continuation of the prior move. Implications and outcomes : Usually signal that the earlier sharp move is likely to be extended once the consolidation phase concludes. The expectation is more directional toward a continuation of the trend that led to the pennant's formation. As with most technical analyses , symmetrical triangle patterns work best with other indicators and chart patterns. Traders often look for a high-volume move to confirm a breakout and may use different technical indicators to determine how long the breakout might last. For example, the relative strength index (RSI) may be used to determine when a security has become overbought following a breakout. Six key components help in identifying a symmetrical triangle: converging trend lines, volume, duration, breakout point, price target, and market sentiment. Traders should first identify two converging trend lines, one moving up and the other moving down. The upper trend line connects lower highs, while the lower trend line connects higher lows. The convergence of these trend lines indicates that buyers and sellers are unsure of the market's direction, producing a consolidation phase. Volume usually decreases during the pattern's formation, showing market indecision. A noticeable drop in trading volume can be a crucial indicator of a symmetrical triangle formation. When the breakout occurs, there should be a significant increase in volume, confirming the pattern's validity and the new direction of the price movement. Regarding duration, symmetrical triangles can form over various time frames, from weeks to months. A longer pattern typically leads to a more significant breakout. The symmetrical triangle chart pattern ends when the price breaks out of the converging trend lines. This breakout is a critical indicator of the future price direction. Breakouts can be upward or downward. Once a breakout occurs, traders can estimate the price target by measuring the widest part of the triangle and projecting that distance from the breakout point. This measurement forecasts how far the price might move following the breakout. Finally, while the symmetrical triangle does not indicate the direction of the breakout, it reflects a period of equilibrium between supply and demand. Traders and analysts often interpret the direction of the breakout as the direction in which the market sentiment has shifted. Identifying a symmetrical triangle requires patience and practice since the pattern develops over time. Traders and analysts should watch for these formations closely, as they can precede significant price moves. Julie Bang / Investopedia Trading strategies based on symmetrical triangle patterns focus on identifying consolidation periods followed by a significant breakout, which signals the next likely price movement. While the pattern marks a continuation, it can break out in either direction. Thus, once one is identified, careful planning and confirmation are required to execute trades successfully. First, identify the chart pattern by spotting the converging trend lines, with one ascending and the other descending. The pattern should have at least two lower highs and two higher lows touching the trend lines. Patience is key. Traders should wait for the price to break out of the triangle pattern convincingly; the price should close outside the trend lines. Looking at the volume is critical to confirm breakouts since they are accompanied by a significant increase, which signals the strength behind the price movement. A breakout without a notable change in volume is less reliable. Once a breakout is confirmed with volume, traders should enter a trade in the breakout's direction. Some traders may wait for a minor retracement toward the trend line, which would now act as support or resistance, as a more conservative entry point. Experienced traders put stop-loss orders just outside the opposite trend line of the breakout to minimize losses should the market move against the trade. The projected movement after a breakout can be estimated by measuring the triangle's height and then projecting that distance from the breakout point. As with any financial theory, there are risks. False breakouts are common in symmetrical triangle patterns. They occur when the price breaks out of the triangle but then quickly reverses in opposite direction. Traders should look for confirmation with volume indicators or a retest of the trend line before considering the breakout valid. They should also set stop-loss orders just outside the trend line to protect against large losses from false breakouts. Traders may consider additional technical analysis indicators for further confirmation. Some indicators include moving average crossovers or momentum indicators such as the RSI or moving average convergence divergence . The following chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern in the trading of Northwest Bancshares ( NWBI ): Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2021 In this example, the symmetrical triangle suggests the stock is consolidating before a breakout. The expected price move after the breakout equals the triangle's height. This number is added to the breakout point for an upward breakout or subtracted for a downward breakout. Assuming an upward breakout at $17.20, the price target would be $19.40 ($17.20, the breakout level, plus $2.20, the triangle's height). The stop-loss for an upward breakout should be set slightly below the breakout point to protect against false breakouts or a reversal in price direction. In this example, a stop loss at $16.40 provides a safety net, ensuring that the trade is exited if the price falls back below this level. For a downward trend breakout or a breakdown, the stop loss is put slightly above the most recent resistance or the breakdown point to minimize potential losses if the price reverses direction. The $17.20 stop loss should be chosen to limit losses on the downside, offering a buffer against minor retracements that do not offset the overall pattern. False breakouts can occur in symmetrical triangle patterns, as with many other chart patterns in technical analysis. A false breakout happens when the price moves beyond the boundary of the pattern but then reverses direction and fails to sustain the breakout. This can mislead traders into believing that a significant price move is underway when, in fact, the market does not follow through in the expected direction. Symmetrical triangles differ from ascending and descending triangles primarily in the direction of their breakout signals. Ascending triangles, characterized by a flat upper trend line and a rising lower trend line, often signal a bullish breakout, suggesting that buyers are gaining strength. Descending triangles, with a flat lower trend line and a declining upper trend line, typically indicate a bearish breakout, suggesting that sellers are taking control. Several chart patterns in technical analysis resemble the symmetrical triangle in appearance and signal potential market moves. Some patterns include the ascending triangle, the descending triangle, pennants, and wedges . Each pattern has its own significance in technical analysis, providing signals for price moves. Like the symmetrical triangle, recognizing these patterns early and understanding their implications can help traders make better trading decisions. The symmetrical triangle pattern, identified by converging trend lines, signifies a period of consolidation and market equilibrium. This pattern is neutral and could break out in either direction, making it essential for traders to watch closely for a decisive breakout accompanied by increased volume. Effective trading strategies around symmetrical triangles focus on waiting for confirmation of the breakout direction, managing risk with well-placed stop-loss orders, and setting price targets based on the triangle's dimensions. Traders should incorporate additional technical indicators to strengthen their analysis and avoid potential false breakouts.
