## Key Concepts

A stock gap represents a discontinuity in a security's price on a chart, often caused by impactful news or events outside of regular trading hours. These gaps can signal potential market shifts, and understanding the four types—common, breakaway, runaway, and exhaustion—helps traders make informed decisions. Gaps typically occur when a piece of news or an event causes a flood of buyers or sellers into the security. It results in the price opening significantly higher or lower than the previous day’s closing price. Depending on the gap type, it may signal the start of a new trend or reversal of an old one. Gapping occurs when the price of a security or asset opens well above or below the previous day’s close with no trading activity in between. Partial gapping occurs when the opening price is higher or lower than the previous day’s close but within the previous day’s price range. Full gapping occurs when the opening is outside of the previous day’s range. Gapping, especially a full gap, shows a strong shift in sentiment that occurred overnight. Some traders make it a strategy to profit from playing the gap when such a situation occurs. There are limitations despite gaps being easy to spot. The glaring flaw is one's own ability to identify the different types of gaps that occur. If a gap is misinterpreted, it could be a disastrous mistake causing one to miss an opportunity to either buy or sell a security, which could weigh heavily on one's profits and losses. There are some fundamental differences between the different types of gaps: common gaps , breakaway gaps , runaway gaps , and exhaustion gaps . Each gap type affects traders differently. Reversal and breakaway gaps often see a sharp rise in trading volume, unlike common and runaway gaps. Most gaps occur after news events, earnings, or analyst upgrades/downgrades. Common gaps occur more frequently and often without a clear reason. They usually get filled, while other gaps might signal a trend change or continuation. In the example below of Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ), a small stock gap occurred between Oct. 26, 2023, and Oct. 27, 2023, when the price jumped from $119.57 to $127.74. This was a reversal of a downward trend which saw the stock's price continue to climb. In the next example, of Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ), a gap can be seen from Oct. 24, 2023, to Oct. 25, 2023, when the price fell from $138.81 to $125.61 after weeks of a general price increase. The gap drop did not result in a continued downward trend, instead, the price continued to increase to its pre-gap level, filling the gap. A stock gap is a large jump in a stock's price after the market closes, usually due to some news. When a gap has been filled, this means the stock's price has returned to its "normal" price; the pre-gap price. This happens quite often as the price settles after irrational buying and trading has stopped after the news. Price gap risk is the risk that a security's price will fall or increase dramatically from a market close to a market open, without any trading in between. Traders should plan for price gap risk, such as by closing out orders at the end of the day or putting in stop-loss orders. The amount of times stocks gap really depends on the time frame that a trader is viewing and making trades. The shorter the time frame, the more frequent the gaps. So a daily chart would have more gaps than a monthly chart. Stock gaps occur when an asset’s price jumps significantly between trading sessions due to news or events, leaving a discontinuous space on the chart. These gaps can signal the beginning of a trend or its reversal, depending on their type. It is crucial for traders to accurately identify these gaps—common, breakaway, runaway, or exhaustion—and their causes, as misinterpretation can lead to missed opportunities or losses. Trading strategies might include playing the gap or managing price gap risk with stop-loss orders. Understanding the implications of different gap types helps investors make informed decisions in response to market shifts
