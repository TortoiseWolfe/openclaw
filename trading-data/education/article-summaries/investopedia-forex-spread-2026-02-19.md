## Key Concepts

Few terms in finance are as potentially confusing as "spread." The word carries many meanings, and each is critical to understanding market dynamics and investing strategies. Spreads are important to know for nearly every aspect of financial markets, from the difference between bid and ask prices to more complex options strategies. A spread in finance typically refers to some form of difference or gap between two related values. In stock trading, the spread generally refers to the gap between buying and selling prices. In bonds, it indicates the yield differential between two securities. Options traders use spreads to create sophisticated risk management strategies, while forex traders focus on currency pair differences. Understanding these various types of spreads is crucial for anyone looking to navigate financial markets effectively. They impact the cost of trading and provide a greater understanding of market liquidity, risk, and potential profit opportunities. Below, we remove any confusion among these meanings while detaining their importance for investors. Spreads are the lifeblood of financial markets. They tell us about liquidity, risk appetite, and market efficiency all at once. Let's describe the major types in turn in the order we discuss them below: Most securities sell in a two-sided market, such as most stocks, where there is a bid-ask spread that marks the difference between the highest bid price and the lowest offer. The bid-ask spread is often used to help assess a stock's liquidity. For instance, in the stock market, a highly liquid stock like Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) may have a hypothetical bid price of $150.00 and an ask price of $150.02, resulting in a spread of just $0.02. This tight spread suggests a highly liquid market with many buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, a thinly traded stock, like a small-cap company, might have a bid price of $10.00 and an ask price of $10.50, resulting in a much larger spread of $0.50. This wider spread shows lower liquidity, higher volatility, and greater transaction costs for traders. The bid-ask spread is crucial for high-frequency traders or market makers because their profit margins are often derived from these small differences. This spread is between the price of one stock and another. For example, the spread between the prices of common stock and preferred stock of the same company can reveal investor preferences and expectations regarding dividends, growth potential, and risk. Similarly, the spread between different classes of stocks (such as Class A and Class B shares) can signal market sentiment about voting rights or control issues. Spreads in the bond market are crucial indicators of risk, investor sentiment, and economic conditions. These spreads represent the difference between the yields of two bonds, typically reflecting varying levels of credit risk, maturity, or liquidity. Understanding bond spreads is essential for investors seeking to assess the risk-reward balance in their fixed-income portfolios. Yield or interest rate spreads arise from the difference in yields between bonds of different types or groups, maturity dates, or issuers. A prominent example is the yield spread between long-term and short-term government bonds (e.g., the 10-year Treasury yield minus the two-year Treasury yield), known as the "yield curve spread." These spreads are calculated by subtracting the yield of one instrument from another and are typically expressed in basis points (bps) or percentage points. Yield spreads are used as a starting point for determining why there are differences in yields because of maturity, issuer, or economic conditions. For instance, a widening yield curve spread often signals expectations of economic growth, while a narrowing spread suggests concerns about an economic downturn. A type of yield curve spread, these are the yield differences between two bonds of similar maturity but different credit qualities, often expressed as the difference between a corporate bond and a risk-free government bond, such as a U.S. Treasury bond. For example, if a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields 3% and a 10-year corporate bond issued by Company XYZ yields 5%, the credit spread is 2%. This spread compensates investors for the added risk of default associated with the corporate bond. A wider credit spread suggests higher perceived risk, often because of lower credit ratings or expectations of economic instability. During the 2008 financial crisis (as seen in the chart below), credit spreads widened significantly as investors demanded more yield to compensate for the increased risk of corporate defaults. This is the difference in yield between two bonds that are otherwise similar but differ in how much they are traded. A bond with lower liquidity will typically have a higher yield to compensate investors for the difficulty in buying or selling the bond quickly without affecting its price. Liquidity spreads widen during market stress when investors prefer more liquid assets and narrow during periods of market stability. The swap spread is the difference between the yield on a fixed-rate bond , such as a Treasury, and the fixed rate of an interest rate swap. This spread reflects the cost of swapping fixed-interest payments for floating ones and is used as a gauge of credit risk in the interbank market. A widening swap spread can indicate increasing concerns about counterparty risk (the chance the other party will default) in the financial system. The interbank market is a global network where banks lend to and borrow from each other, typically on a short-term basis. It plays a crucial role in maintaining liquidity in the financial system, allowing banks to manage their daily funding needs and meet reserve requirements. Interest rates in the interbank market, such as SOFR , also serve as benchmarks for many other financial products. The Z-spread (zero-volatility spread) is the constant spread that must be added to the risk-free Treasury yield curve to discount a bond’s cash flows back to its current market price. This spread is particularly useful for bonds with complex cash flows , such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or bonds with embedded options. Let's take the example of a corporate bond trading at $105 with a face value of $100 and a 5% coupon rate. To determine the Z-spread, an investor would calculate the spread needed over the Treasury yield curve to make the present value of the bond’s cash flows equal to its market price. If the Z-spread is 1.5%, this means that over the entire Treasury yield curve, the bond offers an additional 1.5% yield to compensate for its credit risk and other factors. The Z-spread is thus commonly used by fixed-income traders to assess the relative value of bonds, especially when comparing bonds with similar credit quality but different structures. The option-adjusted spread (OAS) refines the Z-spread by factoring in the impact of these options on the bond's value. Thus, it's the yield spread that investors would receive over a risk-free rate if a bond did not have any embedded options, such as call or put options. Suppose there's a callable bond issued by Company ABC with a 10-year maturity and a 6% coupon. The bond might trade with a Z-spread of 2%, but because the issuer has the option to call the bond after five years, the OAS might be lower, say 1.5%, after adjusting for the call option's value. This gives investors a clearer picture of the bond's real credit risk and liquidity, excluding the distortions caused by the embedded options. Investors use the OAS to compare bonds with different embedded options. Lending spreads are the difference between the interest rate a lender charges borrowers and the lender’s cost of funds. While bond spreads are covered earlier in this article, lending spreads focus specifically on the margins in various types of loans, such as mortgage, personal, and corporate loans. They are a crucial measure of profitability for financial institutions since they represent the margin earned on loans after accounting for the cost of borrowing money to fund those loans. Here are the main types: Option spreads are trading strategies that involve simultaneously buying and selling two or more options contracts on the same underlying asset, typically with different strike prices, expiration dates, or both. These strategies are designed to limit risk, cut the cost of entering a trade, or increase the potential for profit under specific market conditions. Option spreads can be used for the full range of market scenarios. These are some of these spreads: One type of call spread, the bull call spread, is an options trading strategy designed for traders who expect a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset. The strategy involves buying a call option with a lower strike price and simultaneously selling a call option with a higher strike price, both with the same expiration date. The purchased call option provides the right to buy the asset at the lower strike price, while the sold call option obligates the trader to sell the asset at the higher strike price if exercised. For example, suppose a stock is trading at $50. An investor expecting the stock to rise might buy a call option with a strike price of $50 for a premium of $3 and sell a call option with a strike price of $55 for a premium of $1. The net cost of the spread is $2 ($3 paid for the long call minus $1 received for the short call). The maximum profit is $3, which occurs if the stock price is at or above $55 at expiration (the difference between the strike prices minus the net premium paid). The maximum loss is limited to the $2 net premium paid, which occurs if the stock price remains at or below $50. This strategy provides a way for traders to benefit from a rise in the stock price while limiting potential losses, so when placed side by side with outright buying a call option, it is more balanced. Options spreads are often priced as a single unit or as pairs on derivatives exchanges to ensure the simultaneous buying and selling of a security. Doing so eliminates execution risk in case you execute one part but not the other correctly. A bear put spread is used by traders who expect a moderate decline in the price of the underlying asset. This involves buying a put option with a higher strike price and selling a put option with a lower strike price, both with the same expiration date. The long put option provides the right to sell the asset at a higher strike price, while the short put option obligates the trader to buy the asset at a lower strike price if exercised. For example, suppose an investor believes that the stock price of XYZ Company, currently trading at $52, will decrease soon. They carry a bear put spread to profit from this potential decline. The investor buys one put option with a strike price of $50 (higher strike) and sells one put option with a strike price of $45 (lower strike). Both options have the same expiration date. The potential results are below: A bull put spread is an options trading strategy that investors use when they have a moderately bullish outlook on an underlying asset. This vertical spread (those that buy and sell options of the same type) involves simultaneously selling a put option at a higher strike price and buying a put option at a lower strike price, with both options having the same expiration date. The goal is to profit from a rise in the underlying asset's price or from staying stable above the higher strike price. This strategy allows traders to generate income through the premium from selling the put option while the purchased put works as a hedge to limit potential losses. The maximum profit for a bull put spread is achieved if the underlying asset's price closes above the higher strike price at expiration, allowing both options to expire worthless and the trader to keep the entire net premium received. The maximum loss occurs if the asset's price falls below the lower strike price, but this loss is capped and known in advance. Below is a
