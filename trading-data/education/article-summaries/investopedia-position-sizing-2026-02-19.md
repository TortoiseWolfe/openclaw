## Key Concepts

Position sizing refers to the number of units invested in a particular security by an investor or trader. It is an important part of an investment strategy because it impacts both risk management and potential returns. An investor's account size and risk tolerance should be taken into account when determining position size, making it especially relevant for day traders, forex traders, and others looking to balance risk and reward effectively. Position sizing refers to the size of a position within a particular portfolio, or the dollar amount that an investor is going to trade. Investors use position sizing to help determine how many units of security they can purchase, which helps them to control risk and maximize returns. Position sizing is crucial in many investment types, but it's most often linked with day trading and forex . Using correct position sizing involves weighing three different factors to determine the best course of action: Before using correct position sizing for a trade, investors must first figure out their account risk. This typically gets expressed as a percentage of the investor’s capital. As a rule of thumb, most retail investors risk no more than 2% of their investment capital on any one trade; fund managers usually risk less than this amount. For example, if an investor has a $25,000 account and decides to set their maximum account risk at 2%, they cannot risk more than $500 per trade (2% x $25,000). Even if the investor loses 10 consecutive trades in a row, they have only lost 20% of their investment capital. The investor must then determine where to place their stop-loss order for the specific trade. For stock trades, the trade risk is the dollar difference between the entry price and the stop-loss. For example, if an investor intends to purchase Apple Inc. at $160 and place a stop-loss order at $140, the trade risk is $20 per share. The investor now knows that they can risk $500 per trade and is risking $20 per share. To work out the correct position size from this information, the investor simply needs to divide the account risk, which is $500, by the trade risk, which is $20. This means 25 shares can be bought ($500 / $20). Investors should be aware that even if they use correct position sizing, they may lose more than their specified account risk limit if a stock gaps below their stop-loss order. If expecting volatility, like before earnings reports, investors might halve their position size to cut gap risk. Position sizing is essential for managing risk and optimizing returns by aligning trade size with account size and risk tolerance. Investors should factor in account and trade risk to set effective stop-loss orders and avoid heavy losses, while staying alert to gap risk during volatile periods. Regularly reassessing position sizing ensures it remains aligned with evolving goals and market conditions.
