## Key Concepts

We learned all about mechanical trading systems in the School of Pipsology. We even learned how to design and build our own forex trading systems. But like men, not all mechanical trading systems are created equally. Some systems, called trend-following systems, do a better job at catching strong directional moves, while others, known as mean reversion systems, are better for spotting probable currency pair reversal points. Just like a pair of sneakers, your mechanical trading system should fit you well, or else you could end up hurting yourself. This personality test can help you determine which kind of mechanical system best suits your personality so that you can run your forex trading system without falling flat on your face. Take the results with a grain of salt. The results you get are just recommendations based on your answers and are meant to get you onto the right path. As you get better, keep an open mind to all new experiences and realities to help you evolve and grow your trading abilities.
