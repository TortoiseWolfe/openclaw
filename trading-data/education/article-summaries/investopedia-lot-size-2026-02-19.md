## Key Concepts

Currencies are traded in lots rather than singular units. There are four common sizes: standard, mini, micro, and nano. A standard lot is also referred to as one lot and the largest. A standard lot is the equivalent of 100,000 units of the base currency in a forex trade. Get personalized, AI-powered answers built on 27+ years of trusted expertise. The biggest lot size is the standard and the smallest is the nano. Traders invest less money with nano lots than with the standard lot, limiting risk and potential returns. Professional traders commonly choose standard lots. Mini lots are used by intermediate traders with less trading capital. Micro and nano lots are used by beginners who want to experiment in forex markets without risking much capital. See Investopedia's choices for Best Forex Brokers . A pip is the smallest unit price move an exchange rate can make based on forex market convention. A pip is one-hundredth of 1% (1/100 x .01) and appears in the fourth decimal place (0.0001). Each pip movement holds greater weight with a standard lot. In most cases, a one-pip movement is worth the following monetary amounts, barring a few currency pair exceptions: The value of a one-pip movement may be different in some currency pairs. Competitive pricing is one benefit of investing in a bigger lot size. Investors will generally get a lower spread or commission when making larger trades. However, it's not likely to be an affordable option for most investors. Individuals trade currencies in pairs. Investors might buy the EUR/USD currency pair if they believe the euro will strengthen in value against the U.S. dollar. If a euro is worth about $1.075, an investor will need 107,500 units of USD, the quote currency , at this price to buy 100,000 units of EUR, the base currency or the currency they want to invest in. A one- pip movement for a standard lot generally corresponds with a $10 change. An investor would make a profit of 10 pips or $100 if the exchange rate of the EUR/USD pair moved from 1.0701 to 1.0711. In the foreign exchange markets, traders buy and sell currency in large lots rather than individual units. The largest lot is a standard lot, representing 100,000 of a base currency. Using standard lots allows a high degree of decimal precision. If an investor is trading the USD/EUR pair, the base currency is the U.S. dollar. If USD/EUR is trading at €0.8790, then it costs €87,900 to buy a standard lot of U.S. dollars. Leverage is capped at 50:1 on most currency pairs and at 20:1 on others. A standard lot in forex is equal to 100,000 currency units. One standard lot of the base currency would be 107,300 units or $107,300 if you buy EUR/USD when the exchange rate is $1.073, the value of one euro. One standard lot represents 100,000 units, so five represent 500,000 units. A trade of this size would generally be executed by institutional investors or by individual traders with very deep pockets. A 0.1 lot is a mini lot. It's one-tenth of a standard lot. A lot is a standardized unit of measurement used in the forex market. Investors have four lots to choose from and the standard lot is the largest, representing 100,000 units of the base currency in a currency pair. It’s possible to make and lose significant amounts of money with this number of units because investors are betting that one currency will either rise or fall in value against another.
