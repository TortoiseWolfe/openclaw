## Key Concepts

We covered regular divergences in the previous lesson, now let’s discuss what hidden divergences are. What’s a hidden divergence ? Divergences not only signal a potential trend reversal but can also be used as a possible sign for a trend continuation (price continues to move in its current direction). Always remember, the trend is your friend , so whenever you can get a signal that the trend will continue, then good for you! Hidden bullish divergence happens when the price is making a higher low (HL), but the oscillator is showing a lower low (LL). Hidden Bullish Divergence This can be seen when the pair is in an UPTREND. Once price makes a higher low (HL), look and see if the oscillator does the same. If it doesn’t and makes a lower low (LL) , then we’ve got some hidden divergence in our hands. Hidden Bearish Divergence Lastly, we’ve got hidden bearish divergence. This occurs when price makes a lower high (LH), but the oscillator is making a higher high (HH) . By now you’ve probably guessed that this occurs in a DOWNTREND. When you see hidden bearish divergence, chances are that the pair will continue to shoot lower and continue the downtrend . Let’s recap what you’ve learned so far about hidden divergence . If you’re a trend follower, then you should dedicate some time to spot some hidden divergence. If you do happen to spot it, it can help you jump in the trend early . Sounds good, yes? Keep in mind that regular divergences are possible signals for trend reversals while hidden divergences signal trend continuation . Regular divergences = signal possible trend reversal Hidden divergences = signal possible trend continuation In the next lesson, we’ll show you some real-world examples of when divergences existed and how you could have traded them.
