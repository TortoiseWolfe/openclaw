## Key Concepts

A trailing stop is a type of stop-loss order that automatically adjusts with the market price to lock in profits and limit losses. It helps traders stay in winning positions as long as the market moves in their favor—and exit automatically if the trend reverses. Trailing stops work best in trending markets, offering a disciplined way to manage risk without constantly monitoring every price move. Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu A stop order exits a long or short position when the price hits a certain level. A trailing stop is simply a stop order that automatically follows—or trails—the market once the price of a security has initially begun moving in a favorable direction. If the market later reverses direction, the stop price will remain fixed, and the exit order will be placed if the stop price is hit. The goal is to protect existing profits on the trade. Otherwise, if you leave only your initial stop, or none at all, a once-winning trade could turn into a loser. That's a losing strategy overall. The concept is simple enough. But deciding where to place the trailing stop is challenging. If you set the trailing stop too close to the current price, normal price swings that don't constitute a true reversal could stop you out, leaving money on the table. If the stop is too far away, a true reversal could end up chewing up more of your potential profit than necessary—or even all of it. The answer depends on several factors, including the time frame you're trading, the volatility of the market you're trading, and personal choice. Trailing stops help eliminate emotion when exiting trades, perhaps the most important part of trading. There are several types of trailing stops, each with different ways of determining where to place stops as the market continues to move. Here are some of the most common: Using a hypothetical example: Let's say NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ) hypothetically breaks to a new high at $100 and you buy. You decide you're willing to risk a 5% loss on the initial entry, so you put the first stop at $95. The stock then moves to $110. Your position is showing a profit and you decide 10% is an appropriate trailing stop given the stock's volatility . So you set the trailing stop at 10%, which at this point would be $99 (110 - (11 × 0.10)). As the price continues to rise, the trailing stop automatically rises with it. When the price reaches $120, the trailing stop is at $108, ensuring at the very least that you'll secure a profit of 8%. The stock eventually closes as high as $135. At that point, your stop would be at $121.50 (135- (135 × 0.10)). Three days later it crosses below that level before closing at $118. Your stop is triggered at $121.50, so you secure a profit of 21.5%, assuming perfect execution. It will be months before NVDA trades above $135 again, and, in the meantime, it will fall as low as about $90. If you had set a looser stop—say 20%—you would have been stopped out at $108, meaning what had been a 35% profit ended up at 8% (instead of 21.5% with a 10% stop). In this way, you've not only secured a solid profit with a 10% trailing stop, you've freed yourself up to pursue other prospects NVDA trades sideways for an extended period. Reduces Emotion in Trading Automates Risk Management Useful Exit Strategy for Trending Markets Not Suited for all Market Stages or Time Frames Risks Premature Exits Trailing stops offer a powerful way to lock in profits while letting winning trades run. By tracking the market while it moves in a favorable direction, a well-placed trailing stop ensures traders don't give back significant gains to reversals. Trailing stops also help automate exits and avoid emotional decision-making. But trailing stops aren't always the best choice for exiting a trade. They work best in trending markets and are generally not well-suited for day trading. They are also best deployed by people with at least a basic understanding of technical analysis.
