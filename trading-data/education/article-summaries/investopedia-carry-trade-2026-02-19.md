## Key Concepts

A currency carry trade involves shopping for the lowest interest rates for borrowing, then putting those funds into higher-percentage assets in another currency. These trades have traditionally been among the most popular ways professional and institutional traders make money in the foreign exchange ( forex ) market. The strategy is straightforward: borrow money in a country where interest rates are low, like Japan (where for decades going into the mid-2020s, rates had been near zero), and invest that money in a country where rates are higher, like Australia, New Zealand, or the U.S. The difference between these rates is where traders profit. Below, we take you through the strategy, how it works, and when it doesn't—the last is a critical point to review given that many traders have lost their footing as the structure of these markets has changed in recent years.

While most think of currency trades as an attempt to break even—you're hoping to get as near as possible to the value of your home currency when at an exchange booth abroad—it's an attempt to apply the “buy low, sell high” motto and profit from these lateral trades. But how? In currency carry trading, when interest rates in a country decrease, speculators often take advantage of the lower cost of borrowing in that nation's currency—called the " funding currency ." They borrow at the reduced interest rate to fund investments in higher-yielding currencies or assets. The goal is to "carry" the interest rate differential as profit. For example, from the late 2000s to 2024, the Japanese yen ( JPY ) was known for offering a significant difference in interest rates against important global currencies, such as the Australian dollar ( AUD ) and the New Zealand dollar ( NZD ). The trade was so robust and seemed to come off with such relative ease, given the stability of Japan's low rates, that many in the financial media came to call it "a cost-free source of profit." But that wasn't and isn't true since these trades come with significant risks and, thus, substantial costs should the economics shift in the wrong direction for you. As in the rest of finance, if there were a cost-free way to profit, word would have gotten around—and you wouldn't have that "cost-free" profit very long. That's because, unlike simply moving money among local banks, carry trades have an extra layer of complexity, meaning more risk. When dealing with different currencies, their values can change against each other, potentially wiping out any profits from the interest rate difference. It's like trying to catch two moving targets at once: you need both the interest and exchange rates to work in your favor. Until 2024, borrowing in JPY to invest in higher-yielding currencies was so popular that it made up about one-fifth of daily currency trading—and one can understand why it was depicted as a relatively easy trade. But when the Bank of Japan suddenly raised rates to levels not seen in over a decade—rates, by the way, that was still a tenth or less than in the U.S. and other major central economies—it caused a market earthquake that revealed just how risky these seemingly safe trades can be. Investors often speak of escaping to safe havens when the markets get rough—think of buying Treasurys when stocks are declining. But the carry trade itself tends to be a "safe haven" form of trading—it tends to only work when there's stability (or traders are oblivious to it not being so)—like a small sail boat, you don't want to take it out in anything but the fairest conditions. The carry trade is like a global version of arbitrage between savings accounts but with much higher stakes. How does it work? Let's say you notice Japanese banks are offering loans at 0.5% interest while U.S. bonds are paying 4%. Professional traders might borrow significant amounts of yen (it has to be enough so the interest rate differential can make up for administrative costs and the risks involved), convert it to dollars, and invest in those higher-yielding U.S. bonds. As long as exchange rates stay stable, traders earn the difference between the two interest rates—in this case, about 3.5%. However, most professionals don't actually exchange physical currency. Instead, they use currency futures or forward currency markets, where they can borrow money (i.e., use leverage) to magnify their returns. This leverage is why carry trades can be so profitable—and so disastrous—your potential losses are also magnified. It's like putting a small down payment on a house but getting returns on the full value. When things go well, you make money on money you never had. If things go badly, you can lose far more than your initial investment. Considering that some forex brokers offer leverage as high as 300 to one (that is, loans as high as 300 times the value for the underlying asset), it’s not hard to see the appeal of carry trading. It should be equally easy to see how disastrous the outcome can be once the underlying dynamics (interest and currency exchange rates) swing against you. That's why traders must ensure they're always ready to unwind their short positions—repay the borrowed currency—before interest rates increase, as rising rates could make holding or repaying these positions far more costly. The key to carry trading isn't just finding the biggest interest rate difference—it's understanding when market conditions make the strategy too risky. Carry trades thrive on the difference in interest rates between countries, and while USD/JPY is one of the most well-known pairs, several others have been popular: Australian Dollar (AUD)/JPY The Australian dollar typically offers higher interest rates because of its commodities-driven economy, while Japan's rates are historically low. This pair is favored during stable global growth and strong demand for raw materials. New Zealand Dollar (NZD)/JPY Like the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar often has higher interest rates, making this another attractive pair for carry traders, especially during periods when agricultural exports are up the markets have low volatility. USD/Swiss Franc (CHF) The Swiss franc's traditionally low rates, driven by its role as a safe-haven currency, contrast with the relatively higher rates in the US, creating opportunities for carry trades. Euro/Turkish Lira ( TRY ) This trade exploits the higher interest rates in Turkey compared with the eurozone. However, it's riskier because of Turkey's economic volatility and political instability. The best time to start a carry trade is when central banks are raising interest rates or signaling they might do so. For example, if the U.S. Federal Reserve is hiking rates while Japan keeps rates low, more traders will borrow in yen to buy dollar assets. As more people make this trade, it tends to push up the value of the dollar against the yen, creating even more profits for early movers. However, experienced traders watch for several warning signs that it's time to exit: The 2024 Japanese yen episode offers an unfortunate example. When the Bank of Japan unexpectedly raised rates, traders who had borrowed in yen faced a double hit: they had to pay higher interest on their loans and watched the yen strengthen against other currencies, making their debts more expensive to repay. The Bank of Japan's ultralow rates were meant to boost Japan's economy by encouraging domestic borrowing and spending. Instead, global traders used this cheap yen financing to invest in higher-yielding U.S. assets—not exactly what Japanese policymakers intended for their monetary policy. Let's walk through an example of how a carry trade works. Suppose Japanese interest rates are at about 0.5% and U.S. rates are at 4%. A trader borrows 50 million yen (about $434.8k at an exchange rate of 115 yen per dollar). After converting to dollars and investing at the U.S. rate of 4% for a year, the trader would have $452,174. Meanwhile, they'd owe 50.25 million yen in Japan (the original 50 million plus 0.5% interest). If the exchange rate stayed at 115 yen per dollar, that debt would equal about $437k. The difference—about $15,217—is the trader's profit, representing the 3.5% spread between U.S. and Japanese rates. However, here's the catch: If the yen strengthens against the dollar, these profits can quickly evaporate. This is exactly what happened in 2024 when Japan raised rates, causing the yen to surge and wiping out many traders' gains. The data on overnight rates for the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve shows a significant shift that brought about considerable trouble for major players in the carry trade market in August 2024. Let's review what happened with a simplified timeline of events: 2023 : A Long and Stable Period Continues Early 2024: Warning Signs Market Shocks in August 2024 Post-August 2024: Continued Unwinding The effects of the carry trade unwinding in August 2024 weren't just felt among forex traders, as the S&P 500 index and other market benchmarks dropped significantly. Yet, both the crisis itself and its effects on the wider markets were ultimately based on what a Bank for International Settlements report noted was "seemingly minor news." While carry trades can look like easy money in calm markets, they come with several major risks: Yes, it's one of the most popular forex trading strategies . Carry trade can be entered by simply finding and selling a low-yielding currency and buying a high-yielding one. That said, given many structural changes in the market in recent decades, carry traders say there are fewer prospects on which to trade. Yes, they're a strategy that extends to many assets. In fixed-income markets, for instance, investors often borrow in low-interest-rate environments to buy higher-yielding bonds , capturing the spread as profit. Likewise, in stocks, traders can borrow cheaply to invest in dividend-paying stocks or sectors offering attractive yields. This approach also applies to commodities, where traders might fund positions in contango markets —where future prices exceed spot prices—to profit from the price differential. Even real estate investors use carry-like strategies, borrowing at low rates to buy properties in regions with higher rental yields or potential for price appreciation. Yes. Investors might borrow in low-yield stable coins to invest in higher-yield protocols or tokens. The spread between borrowing costs and staking or lending returns mirrors a traditional carry trade. As with anything in the crypto space, however, there are extreme risks and volatility—typically not a space where carry trades do well. The best time to get into a carry trade is when central banks are raising interest rates—or thinking about doing so. People entering the carry trade will further help push up the value of the currency pair. Currency carry trades—borrowing in a low-interest currency to invest in a higher-yielding one—can seem deceptively simple and profitable, especially during calm market periods. However, as the 2024 Japanese yen episode demonstrated, these trades can quickly unwind when market conditions change. Carry trades work best in stable conditions but can rapidly deteriorate when multiple risks converge, particularly for traders using leverage to increase potential returns. While professional and institutional traders can profit from interest rate differences between countries, the strategy involves significant risks from exchange rate shifts, sudden interest rate changes, and market sentiment swings.
