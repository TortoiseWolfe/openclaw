## Key Concepts

During Junior Year in the School of Pipsology, we learned that each forex trader is unique and that various trading styles fit different types of personalities. If your personality doesn’t match your style of trading, you could wind up hurting your account AND your ego. This quiz can help you find out whether you are better off as a scalper, a day trader, a swing trader, or a position trader. Disclaimer: Take the results with a grain of salt. The results you get are just recommendations based on your answers and are meant to get you onto the right path. As you get better, keep an open mind to all new experiences and realities to help you evolve and grow your trading abilities.
