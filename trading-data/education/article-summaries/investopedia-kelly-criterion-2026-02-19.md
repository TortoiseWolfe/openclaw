## Key Concepts

The Kelly Criterion began as a Bell Labs formula for improving signal clarity and is now used in investing and gambling to decide how much to allocate to an opportunity. It aims to limit losses and increase gains through thoughtful position sizing, a method even investors like Warren Buffett have noted. By weighing win probability against the win-to-loss ratio, it estimates an appropriate investment size. John Kelly, who worked for AT&T's Bell Laboratory, originally developed the Kelly Criterion to assist AT&T with its long-distance telephone signal noise issues. The method was published as "A New Interpretation of Information Rate" soon after in 1956. Then the gambling community got wind of it and realized its potential as an optimal betting system in horse racing. It enabled gamblers to maximize the size of their bankroll over the long term. Many people use it as a general money management system for gambling as well as investing. The Kelly Criterion strategy is said to be popular among big investors, including Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, along with legendary bond trader Bill Gross. There are two basic components to the Kelly Criterion. The first is the win probability or the odds that any given trade will return a positive amount. The second is the win/loss ratio . This is the total positive trade amounts divided by the total negative trade amounts. Investors can put Kelly's system to use by following these simple steps: The percentage is a number less than one that the equation produces to represent the size of the positions you should be taking. For example, you should take a 5% position in each of the equities in your portfolio if the Kelly percentage is 0.05. This system essentially lets you know how much you should diversify . The system does require some common sense, however. One rule to keep in mind regardless of what the Kelly percentage may tell you is to commit no more than 20% to 25% of your capital to one equity. Allocating any more than this carries far more investment risk than most people should be taking. This system is based on pure mathematics but some may question if this math, originally developed for telephones, is effective in the stock market or gambling arenas. An equity chart can demonstrate the effectiveness of this system by showing the simulated growth of a given account based on pure mathematics. In other words, the two variables must be entered correctly and it must be assumed that the investor can maintain such performance. No money management system is perfect. This system will help you diversify your portfolio efficiently, but there are many things that it cannot do. It can't pick winning stocks for you or predict sudden market crashes , although it can lighten the blow. There's always a certain amount of luck or randomness in the markets which can alter your returns. FINRA puts it this way: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." Diversifying means apportioning your investments across different asset classes. One might remain steady as another loses value. Diversifying protects you against losses across the board. Scholars have indicated that the Kelly Criterion can be risky in the short term because it can indicate initial investments and wagers that are significantly large. The formula doesn't change if you apply it to a wager rather than an investment. You're just introducing different but similar factors. The Kelly percentage will tell you how much you should gamble after calculating the probability that you'll win, how much of the bet you'll win, and the probability that you'll lose. You can also take the easy way out and just purchase an app . Money management cannot guarantee spectacular returns, but it can help limit losses and improve gains through balanced diversification. The Kelly Criterion is one tool investors and gamblers use to size bets or investments, though it depends on accurate inputs like win probability and the win-to-loss ratio. It's often paired with other approaches because it can be aggressive in the short term and doesn't account for sudden market swings.
