## Key Concepts

A pip is the smallest whole unit price move that an exchange rate can make, based on forex market convention. A pip is one-hundredth of 1% (1/100 × 0.01), Most currency pairs are priced out to four decimal places, so a single pip is in the fourth decimal place (i.e., 1/10,000th). For example, the smallest whole unit movement up or down that the USD/CAD currency pair can make is $0.0001, or one pip. Pips, used in forex trading, should not be confused with bps ( basis points ), which are used in interest rate markets and represent 1/100th of 1% (i.e., 0.01%).

Forex traders buy and sell a currency whose value is expressed in relation to another currency. Quotes for these forex pairs appear as bid and ask spreads that are accurate to four decimal places. Movement in the exchange rate is measured by pips. Since most currency pairs are quoted to a maximum of four decimal places, the smallest whole unit change for these pairs is one pip. “Pip” is an acronym for percentage in point or price interest point. A pip’s value depends on the currency pair, the exchange rate, and the trade value. When your forex account is funded with U.S. dollars, and USD is the second of the pair (or the quote currency), such as with the EUR/USD pair, the pip is fixed at 0.0001. In this case, the value of one pip is calculated by multiplying the trade value (or lot size) by 0.0001. So, for the EUR/USD pair, multiply a trade value of, say, 10,000 euros by 0.0001. The pip value is $1. If you bought 10,000 euros against the dollar at 1.0801 and sold at 1.0811, you’d make a profit of 10 pips or $10. If the USD is the first of the pair (or the base currency), such as with the USD/CAD pair, the pip value also involves the exchange rate. Divide the size of a pip by the exchange rate and then multiply by the trade value (or lot size). For example, 0.0001 divided by a USD/CAD exchange rate of 1.2829 and multiplied by a standard lot size of 100,000 results in a pip value of $7.79. If you bought 100,000 USD against the Canadian dollar at 1.2829 and sold at 1.2830, you’d make a profit of 1 pip or $7.79. Japanese yen (JPY) pairs are quoted with two decimal places, marking a notable exception to the four decimal place rule. For currency pairs such as the EUR/JPY and USD/JPY , the value of a pip is 1/100 divided by the exchange rate. For example, if the EUR/JPY is quoted as 132.62, one pip is 1/100 ÷ 132.62 = 0.0000754. With a lot size of 100,000 euros, the value of one pip (in USD) would be $7.54. Fractional pips are smaller than pips and, thus, are a more precise measurement. They may appear as a superscript numeral at the end of a quoted exchange rate or as the fifth digit to the right of the decimal point (or third digit on yen pairs). The fractional pip, or “pipette,” is 1/10 of a pip, even though traders may also refer to it as a pip—which can be unnecessarily confusing. The movement of the exchange rate of a currency pair determines whether a trader makes a profit or loss at the end of the day. A trader who buys the EUR/USD will profit if the euro increases in value relative to the U.S. dollar. If the trader bought the euro for 1.1835 and exited the trade at 1.1901, they would make 66 pips on the trade (1.1901 - 1.1835). Now, consider a trader who buys the Japanese yen by selling the USD/JPY pair at 112.06. The trader loses three pips on the trade if they close out the position at 112.09. They profit by five pips if they close it out at 112.01. While the difference may look small, in the multitrillion-dollar foreign exchange market, gains and losses can add up quickly. For example, on a $10 million position that closed at 112.01, the trader would make ¥500,000. In U.S. dollars, that’s $4,463.89 (¥500,000 / 112.01). A combination of hyperinflation and devaluation can push exchange rates to the point where they become unmanageable. In addition to impacting consumers who are forced to carry large amounts of cash, this can make trading unmanageable, and the concept of a pip loses meaning. A well-known historical example of this occurred in Germany’s Weimar Republic when the exchange rate collapsed from its pre-World War I level of 4.2 marks per dollar to 4.2 trillion marks per dollar in November 1923. Another case in point is the Turkish lira, which reached a level of 1.6 million per dollar in 2001, which many trading systems could not accommodate. The government eliminated six zeros from the exchange rate and renamed it the new Turkish lira. As of February 2024, the average exchange rate was 0.032 lira per dollar (TKY/USD). A pip is the smallest whole unit measurement of the difference between the bid and ask spread in a foreign exchange quote. A pip equals 1/100 of 1% , or 0.0001. Thus, the forex quote extends out to four decimal places. Smaller price increments are measured by fractional pips, or “pipettes.” In the context of the foreign exchange market, a pip is a standard unit of measure for changes in an exchange rate, representing a move of 0.0001 (1/10,000). This is the smallest price change increment for most currency pairs. A pipette equals 1/10 of a pip and represents a fraction of 1/100,000. A pip, therefore, relates to movement in the fourth decimal place, while a pipette is used to measure movement in the fifth decimal place. They are a part of a currency pair’s exchange rate market quote. Pips represent the change in the quote and value of a position in the market you may have taken. Say, hypothetically, you bought a currency pair for 1.1356 and sold it for 1.1360. You made four pips on your trade. You’d have to then calculate the value of a single pip and multiply that by your lot size for the dollar value of your profit. Yes, it does. However, the yen is an exception. A quote for the yen normally extends two decimal places past the decimal point. So, a single whole unit pip is 0.01 rather than the 0.0001 used in other currency pairs. The forex spread is the bid price subtracted from the ask price of a currency pair. For example, if EUR/USD has an ask price of 1.1053 and a bid price of 1.1051, then the spread is 0.0002 or 2 pips. To calculate the cost of the forex spread, you need to multiply the spread by the trade size or volume. For example, if you trade 100,000 units of EUR/USD with a 2-pip spread, then the cost of the spread is $20.00 = (0.0002 × 100,000). The concept of pips is fundamental in the forex market and serves as a significant basis for making trading decisions. A pip is a basic measure used in the forex market for currency movements. It is typically the smallest price move that a given exchange rate makes based on market convention. Understanding pips is crucial for forex traders, as it allows them to quantify the value of their potential gains or losses and manage their leverage and risk accordingly.
