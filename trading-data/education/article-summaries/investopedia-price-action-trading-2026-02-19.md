## Key Concepts

In investing, many traders rely on a deceptively simple approach: watching how prices move. This method, called price action trading, strips away complex mathematical formulas and indicators named with several nouns in a row to focus on what matters most—the actual movement of stock prices over time on price charts. Interpreting price action on technical charts is like reading footprints in the sand—each mark tells a story about who's been there and where they might be heading. Instead of using complicated technical tools, traders who follow this approach study price patterns, support and resistance levels (price points where stocks tend to stop falling or rising), and the psychology driving market participants' decisions. While many trading strategies layer on several indicators like moving averages or momentum oscillators, price action trading cuts through the noise by concentrating on the market's most fundamental element: price. This highly visual approach helps traders spot trends across all kinds of markets—stocks, currencies, commodities, cryptocurrencies, etc.—by identifying repeatable patterns. Below, we take you through the principles of this trading method. Get personalized, AI-powered answers built on 27+ years of trusted expertise. Before turning to price action, it's best to first review the field of technical analysis as a whole. Technical analysts investigate market moves by studying charts rather than company fundamentals. That is, instead of analyzing earnings reports or economic data, technical analysts focus on patterns in price and volume data to predict where markets might head next. The field rests on three key principles: For example, let's say Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL ) stock drops 20%. Technical analysts would focus far more on the price decline itself than the supposed reasons behind it (e.g., a bad earnings report). They believe the market's collective wisdom, revealed through the movement of prices, provides more actionable knowledge than by looking under the hood at a company's fundamentals. Technical analysts say their tools for examining market shifts help them time their entries and exits far more precisely than fundamental analysis alone. Technical analysts use these tools, among others: While critics argue that technical analysis is like reading tea leaves, proponents point to large financial institutions that put their money on the line using these methods. Trading with price action is a technique that involves analyzing a security's historical price movements to make trading decisions without relying on lagging indicators or complex models. For example, say Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) repeatedly stops falling at $215. This price becomes a support level, showing where buyers consistently step in. When enough buyers act at this level, it creates a pattern that price action traders can spot and potentially profit from. Similarly, if Apple struggles to rise above $225 multiple times, this resistance level signals where sellers become active. Price action traders pay attention to several key elements: One way this might work is if traders see that Apple's price has bounced strongly off $215 support with heavy trading volume, they might buy shares, expecting other buyers to do the same. They could then set a protective stop-loss order just below $215 in case the pattern fails, while targeting the previous resistance at $225 for potential profits. For price action enthusiasts, this approach strips away unnecessary complexity to focus on what the market is actually telling us through its movements. Successful price action trading doesn't require expensive software, but it does demand specific tools to analyze markets effectively. Here are the charting tools you'll need: While premium platforms like Bloomberg terminals cost thousands monthly, most retail traders can effectively trade price action using free or low-cost platforms. In addition, many brokers offer built-in charting software at no added cost. But because technical indicators and price moves can only tell you the past, and the future isn't determined, you'll need to manage your risks. Here are some tools to do so: An upshot of price action charts is that by gaining experience with pricing patterns, you can start to recognize institutional money flows without relying on lagging indicators. As you gain experience with price charts, you'll learn how to best interpret shifts in these aspects of them: These are fundamental markers of supply and demand, where price often halts or reverses because of strong buying or selling pressure. Support levels show where buying demand typically emerges. For example, if the value of bitcoin repeatedly bounces off $80,000, this price represents significant demand—buyers consistently step in here, creating a floor for the price. Resistance levels indicate where the selling supply increases. If Apple stock struggles to break above $230 several times, this suggests there are many sellers willing to part with their shares at this price. These occur where supply and demand are balanced, while breakouts from these areas signal one side gaining control. Supply and demand zones are broader areas of interest, often marked by rectangles, indicating significant buying or selling interest during previous price movements, and tend to attract market activity during future pullbacks. Order flow, price gaps , candlestick patterns, and retests of key levels all provide insight into the battle between buyers and sellers. Volume is crucial for price action traders. A high volume at support or resistance suggests stronger interest and a greater likelihood of the price reacting meaningfully. Just as you might not believe a salesperson's claims about a product without proof, a price move without strong volume backing it up might be misleading you. Here's what volume tells traders: Major volume spikes often mark important turning points in price action. Suppose Apple's stock jumps from $215 to $225. You would look at volume to discern the following: Candlestick charts , first developed by Japanese rice traders in the 1700s, tell the story of the market psychology for an asset in single bars. Each candlestick represents a specific period— a minute, hour, day, week, and so on—and shows four crucial pieces of information: the opening price, closing price, highest price (high), and lowest price (low) reached during that period. The opening and closing prices form the "body" of the candle, typically colored green (or white) when the price closes higher than it opened ( bullish ) or red (or black) when the price closes lower than it opened (bearish). The thin lines extending above and below the body, called "wicks" or "shadows," show the highest and lowest prices reached during the fight. A long upper wick suggests sellers stepped in at higher prices, while a long lower wick means buyers emerged to support the price. Common candlestick patterns signal potential reversals or continuations. For example, a "hammer" pattern—which looks like a hammer with a small body at the top and long lower wick—appearing after a downtrend suggests buyers are starting to overcome sellers. Meanwhile, a "shooting star," which looks like an upside-down hammer, appearing after an uptrend warns you that sellers might be taking control (i.e., that prices will drop). When a stock opens for trading much higher or lower than its previous closing price, it creates a gap i n the chart—a space where no trading happens. For example, if Apple closes at $220 but opens the next day at $230 because of great earnings, that $10 space is a gap. Gaps often show a powerful sentiment at work in the market—excitement over good news or panic selling. Many traders watch for price gaps because prices often try to "fill" them later—price charts, like nature, abhor a vacuum. Order flow is like watching a crowded shopping mall during a sale—you can see where people are lining up to buy and where they're walking away. In trading, order flow shows the real-time battle between buyers and sellers by revealing where large orders are placed. For instance, if there are many large buy orders sitting at $50 for a stock, that level might act as strong support. Professional traders watch order flow through special tools that show these orders, giving them insight into where major players like banks and hedge funds might be planning to buy or sell. A retest is like double-checking to ensure you shut off the stove; the market returns to an important price level to see if it still holds. Say a stock breaks above a resistance level at $75, where it had struggled for months. If it later falls back to $75, that's called a retest. Traders watch these retests carefully because they often tell an important story: If the old resistance at $75 now acts as a support (meaning the stock bounces up from there), it's a bullish sign. But if the price crashes back through $75, it might mean the original breakout was false. A successful retest is like getting a second opinion—it confirms the original diagnosis. Advances in chart pattern recognition have made price action trading far easier for those who have access to them. These are programs that automatically scan charts to identify common trading patterns. They act as your high-tech assistant, constantly monitoring thousands of stocks to spot potentially profitable setups that you might otherwise miss. Here are some common types of pattern recognition tools: Even with the newest tech, price action trading is far from simple. Maintaining strict discipline in risk management is as critical as ever, especially given how effortless trade execution has become. We're now ready to look at the two major types of patterns in price action: reversal and continuation patterns. Reversal patterns help traders spot potential turning points where the prevailing trend may be ending, while continuation patterns identify consolidations before a trend resumes. Reversal patterns allow traders to find turning points in the market, providing traders an avenue to expect that an overarching trend is coming to an end and a new one is about to begin. These patterns include head and shoulders , double tops and bottoms, engulfing patterns, morning/evening stars, and wedges . Price action traders use these patterns to determine shifts in market sentiment since they show when supply and demand are shifting. Experienced traders wait for confirmation signals like breaks in trend lines and neck lines or increased volume. In addition, stop-loss orders are used to manage risk since not every pattern will play out as expected. False signals are a major risk in price action trading. That's why traders typically use more than one tool so they can confirm the rationale behind their trades. The other type of price action pattern is the continuation pattern . These are characterized by consolidations within the prevailing trend. Traders who see this pattern will buy or sell based on the view that the price will move in the trend's original direction. Patterns like flags, pennants, and triangles serve as temporary pauses, allowing traders to position themselves to take advantage when the trend resumes. The best setups for trades often have several technical indicators aligning at once. Like reversal patterns, traders wait for confirmation of breakouts, ideally supported by increasing volume, since this shows how strong the move is. Stop losses are in order when trading with these patterns as well. The first example is a chart of the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF ( BOTZ ) with a rising wedge pattern . When the setup was made, a bearish engulfing chart pattern confirmed the bearish sentiment, followed by a breakout below the lower wedge trend line. This was also accompanied by an increase in price, signaling that selling was strong. A stop-loss order was placed at $32.76, and a target of $31.80 was identified based on the rising wedge. There was further confirmation on the trade when a double-top pattern appeared. The volume spike during the breakdown gave the trader additional confidence, reflecting market participation and confirming again the breakout's strength. The trade was eventually a successful one as the price hit the target. In this example, a bearish continuation pennant appeared on the price chart for the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF ( BNDX ). After an initially sharp decline, the price action formed a pennant, which is marked by converging trend lines, indicating a pause before the trend
