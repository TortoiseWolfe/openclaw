## Key Concepts

Congratulations! You’ve completed the “ Beginner’s Guide to Global Liquidity ” course. This is your operational cheat shee t, the same type of metrics that many institutional macro portfolio managers monitor. How to use this guide: Bookmark this page. Check it every Monday morning (10 minutes). Answer the 4 key questions in Section 7. Use Section 8 to determine your positioning What you’ll find: ✅ The indicators (what to check) ✅ The thresholds (what the numbers mean) ✅ The interpretation rules (what’s happening) ✅ Trade implications (what to do) 1. Treasury Liquidity Indicators SOFR vs IORB Spread What you’re checking: Is overnight lending stressed? Signal: Funding stress when SOFR > IORB Condition Interpretation Action SOFR < IORB Stable funding Maintain baseline positioning SOFR = IORB Early stress Add hedges SOFR > IORB for 2+ days Repo stress emerging Expect liquidity injection SOFR > IORB for 5+ days High risk of basis-trade deleveraging Short equities tactically; long gold/BTC Where to check: Federal Reserve Bank of New York (daily at 8:30 AM ET) 🔑 Key insight: When SOFR rises above IORB, banks are desperate for cash. It’s a warning that Fed intervention may be needed. Standing Repo Facility (SRF) Usage What you’re checking: Are banks using the Fed’s emergency lending backstop? Why this matters: The most important real-time signal for repo market stress. SRF Level Interpretation Action < $10B Normal Neutral $10–50B Stress brewing Start layering in gold/BTC > $50B Treasury dysfunction phase Prepare for Fed/Treasury rescue Spike then collapse Liquidity injection succeeded Go long risk assets Where to check: Federal Reserve Bank of New York (daily at 8:30 AM ET) 🔑 Key insight: SRF usage spikes when the repo market is clogged. When it suddenly collapses, the Fed’s intervention worked. It’s probably time to buy risk assets. 2. Treasury General Account (TGA) What you’re checking: Is the government adding or draining liquidity from markets? Why this matters: When TGA goes down, money enters markets. When it goes up, money leaves. TGA Level Interpretation < $400B Liquidity entering markets $400B–$800B Neutral > $800B Liquidity drain; repo tightening risk > $1T High probability of SOFR spike Where to check: U.S. Treasury Department or FRED (search “ WDTGAL “) Critical Rule: If TGA ↑ AND SOFR ↑ , markets enter the danger zone . Translation: Government draining liquidity + banks scrambling for cash = Major stress ahead! Unless the Fed intervenes. 3. Equities and Interest Rates Relationship What you’re checking: Are stocks and bonds moving in unusual patterns? Why this matters: This is the “Doom Loop Detector” when both stocks AND bonds fall together, the Treasury market is breaking. Pattern Meaning Stocks ↑ + Yields ↑ Normal reflation (healthy economy) Stocks ↓ + Yields ↓ Normal risk-off (flight to safety) Stocks ↓ + Yields ↑ Treasury dysfunction → liquidity incoming Where to check: Google “SPX” for stocks, “10-year treasury yield” for bonds Action when the doom loop appears: Go long gold and/or BTC. 🔑 Key insight: When stocks fall but Treasury yields RISE (bonds also selling off), something is broken. The Fed will have to inject massive liquidity. 4. Dollar Trend What you’re checking: Is the dollar strengthening or weakening? Why this matters: Dollar direction tells you if global liquidity is expanding or contracting. Falling dollar = Money flowing into risk assets. Rising dollar = Money fleeing to safety. Both DXY and yields rising = Foreign selling, major problems. The Four DXY Patterns Pattern What It Means What You See Action DXY ↓ (Falling) Liquidity expansion, risk-on Stocks/gold/BTC/commodities rising Stay fully invested, maximum risk DXY ↑ (Rising) Global stress, risk-off Stocks/EM falling, flight to safety Reduce risk 20-30%, hold cash DXY ↑ + Yields ↑ Foreign selling Treasuries (DANGER) EM crisis, bonds selling off Maximum defense, 40-50% cash DXY ↓ + Gold ↑ Policy-driven dollar weakening Gold rallying, real assets outperforming Maximize real assets (gold 20-30%, BTC 10-15%) Where to check: Google “DXY” or use TradingView How to Read DXY Charts Trend over 2-3 months: Higher highs/lows = strengthening; Lower highs/lows = weakening. Magnitude: 2-3% move = normal fluctuation; 5-7% = significant trend; 10%+ = major shift. Key levels: Breaking below 100 after being above 105 = potential regime change; Breaking above 110 = extreme stress. The Dollar Smile Theory The dollar strengthens during both crisis AND strong US growth, but weakens during recovery: Left side (Crisis): Dollar rises on fear → Be defensive. Bottom (Recovery): Dollar falls as liquidity expands → Be aggressive with risk. Right side (Late Cycle): Dollar rises as Fed tightens → Start trimming risk. 5. Gold & Bitcoin Confirmation Signals What you’re checking: Are real assets confirming your liquidity analysis? Why this matters: Gold and bitcoin act as “second opinions” that validate or challenge your primary indicators. Gold Pattern What It Means Gold ↑ while DXY ↓ Policy-induced dollar weakening (bullish) Gold ↑ while yields ↑ Foreign reserve rotation → structural shift (very bullish for gold) Gold ↑ + SRF ↑ Treasury stress → liquidity incoming (Fed rescue imminent) Bitcoin Pattern What It Means BTC ↑ during TGA ↑ Stablecoin-driven liquidity (crypto-native demand) BTC ↑ during gold ↑ Neutral-collateral bid (alternatives to the financial system) BTC ↑ + DXY ↓ Global liquidity expansion wave (perfect storm for BTC) Where to check: Google “gold price” and “bitcoin price” 🔑 Key insight: When BOTH gold and bitcoin are rising together while DXY falls, you have maximum liquidity expansion. Be aggressive with risk assets. 6. M2 Money Supply (Long-Term Indicator) What you’re checking: Is the broad money supply expanding or contracting? Why this matters: M2 is your long-term strategic indicator. It predicts inflation 12-18 months ahead and stock markets 6-12 months ahead. What Is M2? M2 measures all readily available money: cash, checking accounts, savings deposits, small CDs (<$100K), and retail money market funds. Current US M2: ~$22 trillion. M2 Growth Thresholds M2 YoY Growth Interpretation Implication >15% Extreme expansion Expect high inflation in 12-18 months >10% Rapid expansion Expect inflation; position for real assets 5-7% Healthy/sustainable Normal growth environment <5% Below trend Watch for slowdown Flat or negative Contraction Expect disinflation/deflation; recession risk The Critical Lag M2 → Inflation: 12-18 months M2 → Stock markets: 6-12 months M2 → Bitcoin: 70-107 days (highest sensitivity) Historical proof: M2 peaked at 27% YoY in February 2021 → CPI peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 (exactly 16 months later). M2 + Balance Sheet Combination Matrix M2 Growth Balance Sheet Positioning Logic >10% YoY Expanding 🚀 Maximum risk-on Double tailwind >10% YoY Contracting 🟡 Selective risk Mixed signals, favor long-term 5-7% YoY Expanding 🟢 Moderate risk-on Healthy growth 5-7% YoY Contracting 🟠 Cautious Neutral conditions <5% or negative Expanding 🟡 Selective Short-term boost, long-term concern <5% or negative Contracting 🔴 Maximum defense Double headwind Strategic Allocation by M2 When M2 >10% YoY: Overweight growth stocks, tech, small-caps. Accumulate bitcoin and crypto. Build commodity positions ahead of inflation. Underweight long-term bonds. Minimize cash (being debased). When M2 5-7% YoY: Balanced allocation. Focus on fundamentals and valuations. When M2 is flat or negative: Reduce stocks, favor quality/value. Minimal crypto exposure. Overweight bonds (yields falling). Higher cash allocation. Where to check: FRED series “M2SL” or Federal Reserve H.6 release 7. Weekly Synthesis Framework Your Monday Morning Checklist (Answer These 4 Questions): 1. Is liquidity entering or leaving? Check: TGA direction, SRF usage, SOFR level Entering: TGA falling, SRF low, SOFR stable Leaving: TGA rising, SRF elevated, SOFR rising 2. Is the dollar strengthening or weakening? Check: DXY trend over the past month Weakening (DXY ↓): Risk-on environment Strengthening (DXY ↑): Risk-off environment 3. Is Treasury dysfunction present? Check: Are stocks falling AND yields rising at the same time? No: Normal market behavior Yes (for 3+ days): Doom loop—Fed intervention coming 4. Are real assets confirming? Check: Gold and Bitcoin price action Both rising: Confirms liquidity expansion Both falling: Confirms risk-off Mixed: Check which signal is stronger Your Monthly Check (Fourth Tuesday): 5. What is M2 telling you about the next 6-18 months? 10% : Position for inflation and real assets. 5-7% : Normal conditions. <5 % or negative: Position defensively, favor bonds. 8. Action Playbook Use this section to determine your portfolio positioning based on what you see in sections 1-6. Regime 1: Bullish Liquidity (Base Case) You see: TGA ↓ (falling) SRF low (< $10B) SOFR stable (< IORB) DXY drifting down Gold/BTC trending up What it means: Money is flowing into markets. This is the “easy money” environment. Your actions: ✅ Long gold (15-20% of portfolio) ✅ Long BTC (10-15% if comfortable with volatility) ✅ Long equities (60-70%, especially tech/growth) ✅ Curve steepeners (advanced—or just own gold/BTC) ✅ Long TIPS (inflation-protected bonds) Position sizing: Maximum risk-on For FX traders: Short USD across the board (especially vs commodity currencies) Regime 2: Treasury Dysfunction You see: Stocks ↓ Yields ↑ SOFR ↑ SRF ↑ What it means: The plumbing is breaking. Fed rescue is coming. Phase 1: Before Liquidity Injection Your actions: ❌ Short equities (or reduce to 30-40%) ✅ Long volatility (VIX calls or protective puts) ✅ Long USD vs weak EM currencies ✅ Start accumulating gold (5-10%) 💰 Hold 30-40% cash Position sizing: Maximum defense Phase 2: After Liquidity Injection When: Fed announces emergency measures, SRF usage collapses Your actions: ✅ Long gold (20-30%) ✅ Long BTC (15-20%) ✅ Long equities aggressively (especially tech) ✅ Steepeners (or just ride the gold/BTC wave) Position sizing: Aggressive risk-on For FX traders: Flip from long USD to short USD. Regime 3: Geopolitical/Monetary Fracture You see: Gold ↑ strongly (new all-time highs) BTC is volatile but upward trending DXY choppy (no clear trend) EM FX bifurcation (some currencies strong, others weak) What it means: The global monetary system is shifting. De-dollarization accelerating. Your actions: ✅ Overweight gold (25-30%—this is the main event) ✅ Overweight BTC (15-20%) ✅ Overweight resource exporters (commodity producers) ❌ Underweight long-duration nominal assets (avoid long-term bonds) ✅ Long commodity FX (CAD, AUD, NZD) Position sizing: Heavy on real assets, light on financial assets. For FX traders: Focus on commodity currencies vs USD, avoid long-term USD positioning. Regime 4: DXY Rising + Yields Rising (Foreign Selling Crisis) You see: DXY ↑ (strong rally) Treasury yields ↑ (bonds selling off) EM currencies plunging Global deleveraging What it means: Foreign central banks are selling Treasuries to defend their currencies. Toxic combination. Your actions: ❌ Reduce stocks to 30-40% ✅ Gold as insurance (15-20%) ✅ Hold cash/dollars (40-50%) ❌ Avoid all international exposure ✅ Short-term Treasury bills only (not long-term bonds) Position sizing: Maximum defense Quick Decision Matrix Use this table to quickly determine which regime you’re in: TGA SRF SOFR DXY Gold BTC Regime Action ↓ Low Stable ↓ ↑ ↑ Bullish Liquidity Max risk-on ↑ High ↑ Any Any Any Treasury Dysfunction Defensive → Prepare to buy Any Any Any Choppy ↑↑ ↑ Monetary Fracture Heavy gold/BTC ↑ Rising ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ Liquidity Drain Maximum defense DXY Confirmation Matrix DXY Direction Gold SOFR Interpretation Action ↓ Falling ↑ Rising Stable 🚀 Bullish liquidity Maximum risk ↓ Falling → Flat Stable 🟢 Normal risk-on Stay invested ↑ Rising ↓ Falling Stable 🟡 Normal risk-off Reduce risk ↑ Rising ↑ Rising Stable 🤔 Mixed—watch closely Neutral, favor gold ↑ Rising → Any ↑ Rising 🚨 Crisis mode Maximum defense ↓ Falling ↑ Rising ↑ Rising 🟠 Stress + printing Gold/BTC heavy Tips for Using This Dashboard 1. Check weekly, not daily Monday mornings work best. Takes 10 minutes once you have bookmarks set up. Daily checking leads to overtrading. 2. Focus on trends, not single data points One day of SOFR > IORB = Watch Three days = Take action Five days = Red alert 3. Wait for confirmation Don’t act on one indicator alone. Look for 2-3 signals pointing in the same direction. Gold/BTC should confirm your liquidity read. 4. Position sizing is everything Don’t go all-in or all-out. Adjust by 10-20% increments. Keep some cash for opportunities. 5. The Fed rescue trade is the big one Spot: SRF spiking + Doom loop forming. Position: Buy gold, prepare
