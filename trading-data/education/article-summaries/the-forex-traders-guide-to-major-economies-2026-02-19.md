## Key Concepts

Today we’re going to take a trip around the world, but it ain’t gonna take 80 days. If you’re fast enough to keep up, we can probably get around in just 80 seconds! …Not! In any case, we’ll make sure you learn about the nitty-gritty of each major economy and what makes its engine go. For each country that we will be touring, we’ll start off with a quick peek at the important facts and figures , followed by an overview of its economy . Once that’s out of the way, we’ll visit the country’s central bank to find out some of their secrets. In this section, we will explore the powerful monetary policy tools that central banks use to try and “manage” a country’s economy. Hopefully, we’ll stumble into the room where they keep their printing plates and we can sneak out the back door and sell it on the black market. We’re kidding. We’re here to teach you how to trade currencies the legal way. After that, we’ll discuss the important characteristics that differentiate that country’s local currency from all the rest, as well as hard-hitting economic indicators for that country. To keep the trip interesting, we’ll be dishing some trivia and trading tactics every now and then that will prove useful later on when you go off on your pip-catching adventure! And as we promised, this very exclusive field trip is covered by your scholarship. No need for travel visas and no need to buy a travel fanny. Pack light, cause all you’ll need is your hunger for more learning. Are you ready? Let’s get this show on the road!
