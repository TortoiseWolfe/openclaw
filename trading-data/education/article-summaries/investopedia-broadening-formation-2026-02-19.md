## Key Concepts

A broadening formation is a price chart pattern identified by technical analysts. It is characterized by increasing price volatility and diagrammed as two diverging trend lines, one rising and one falling. It usually occurs after a significant rise, or fall, in the action of security prices. It is identified on a chart by a series of higher pivot highs and lower pivot lows.

Broadening formations happen when investors disagree on the right price for a security in a short time. Buyers become increasingly willing to buy at higher prices, while sellers find ever more motivation to take profits. This results in higher temporary price peaks and lower temporary price dips. When connecting these highs and lows, the trend lines form a widening pattern that looks like a megaphone or reverse symmetrical triangle . The price might show random investor disagreements or reflect deeper, fundamental issues. For example, many countries experience broadening formations due to heightened political risk ahead of an upcoming election. Different polling results or candidate policies may cause a market to become very bullish at some points and very bearish at other points. Broadening formations may also occur during earnings season when companies may report differing quarterly financial results that can cause bouts of optimism or pessimism. These formations are rare in normal markets because most markets usually trend in one direction over time. For example, the S&P 500 has consistently moved higher over the long term; therefore, the formations are more common at times when market participants have begun to process a series of unsettling news topics. Topics such as geopolitical conflict or a change of direction in Fed policy, or especially a combination of the two, are likely to coincide with such formations. Broadening formations are usually bearish for long-term investors and trend traders because they show rising volatility without a clear direction. However, they benefit swing and day traders who aim to profit from volatility instead of market direction. These traders rely on technical analysis techniques, such as trendlines or technical indicators, to quickly enter and exit trades that capitalize on short-term movements. The trendlines help them anticipate turning points where they are able to profit from trading decisions if they time the trade successfully or to cut their losses short if the price moves against their position. For instance, swing traders might buy when the price touches a lower trendline and sell when it hits an upper trendline. The widening of these two trendlines means the potential profit for each swing trade is greater than the swing before. Those conditions aren't true if the trendlines were converging (as in a symmetrical triangle) or parallel (as in a price channel ). In addition to looking at trendlines, these traders may look toward momentum indicators to identify the likelihood of a short-term reversal. Day traders tend to see these patterns more often as well since they are focused on shorter time frames lasting minutes or hours. At these time frames, broadening formations tend to be more frequent. Broadening formations, characterized by increasing volatility and diverging trendlines, present unique opportunities for traders seeking to capitalize on market oscillations. While long-term investors and trend traders may find them bearish due to the lack of a clear direction, swing and day traders can benefit from these patterns by leveraging technical analysis to profit from short-term price movements. Understanding and recognizing broadening formations can empower traders to make informed decisions during periods of high market volatility.
