is Forex? Buying And Selling Currency Pairs What is forex trading ? Forex trading is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. Currencies are traded through a “ forex broker ” or “CFD provider” and are traded in pairs . Currencies are quoted in relation to another currency. For example, the euro and the U.S. dollar ( EUR/USD ) or the British pound and the Japanese yen ( GBP/JPY ). When you trade in the forex market, you buy or sell in currency pairs. Imagine each currency pair constantly in a “tug of war” with each currency on its own side of the rope. An exchange rate is the relative price of two currencies from two different countries. Exchange rates fluctuate based on which currency is stronger at the moment. There are three categories of currency pairs: The “ majors “ The “ crosses “ The “ exotics “ The major currency pairs always include the U.S. dollar. Cross-currency pairs do NOT include the U.S. dollar. Crosses that involve any of the major currencies are also known as ” minors”. Exotic currency pairs consist of one major currency and one currency from an emerging market (EM). Major Currency Pairs The currency pairs listed below are considered the “ majors. ” These pairs all contain the U.S. dollar ( USD ) on one side and are the most frequently traded. While there are EIGHT major currencies , there are only SEVEN major currency pairs . Compared to the crosses and exotics, the price moves more frequently with the majors, which provides more trading opportunities.

Liquidity is used to describe the level of activity in the financial market. In forex, it’s based on the number of active traders buying and selling a specific currency pair and the volume being traded. The more frequently traded something is the higher its liquidity. For example, more people trade the EUR/USD currency pair and at higher volumes than the AUD/USD currency pair. This means that EUR/USD is more liquid than AUD/USD. Major Cross-Currency Pairs or Minor Currency Pairs Currency pairs that include any two of the major currencies except the U.S. dollar are known as cross-currency pairs or simply as the “ crosses .” Major crosses are also known as “ minors .” While not as frequently traded as the majors, the crosses are still pretty liquid and still provide plenty of trading opportunities. Don’t confuse minor currency pairs with the seven major currency pairs, all of which include the U. S. dollar against one of the seven other most liquid currencies in the world. The most actively traded crosses are derived from the three major non-USD currencies: EUR , JPY , and GBP .

An exotic currency is a currency from countries with developing or emerging markets. Exotic currency pairs are made up of one major currency paired with the currency of an emerging economy, such as Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Poland, Chile, Turkey, or Hungary. Basically, an exotic currency pair includes one major currency alongside an exotic currency. The chart below contains a few examples of exotic currency pairs. Wanna take a shot at guessing what those other currency symbols stand for? Depending on your forex broker, you may see the following exotic currency pairs so it’s good to know what they are. Keep in mind that these pairs aren’t as heavily traded as the “majors” or “crosses,” so the transaction costs associated with trading these pairs are usually bigger.

Due to the overall lower degree of liquidity, exotic currency pairs tend to be far more sensitive to economic and geopolitical events. For example, a political scandal or unexpected election results can cause an exotic pair’s exchange rate to swing violently. So if you want to trade exotics currency pairs, remember to factor this into your decision. For those of y’all who are really mesmerized by exotics, here’s a more comprehensive list.

There are 180 legal currencies in the world, as recognized by the United Nations. That’s a lot of potential currency pairs! Unfortunately, not all of them are tradable. Forex brokers tend to offer traders up to 70 currency pairs. Aside from the three main categories of currency pairs, there are other “groups” of currencies that are thrown around in the FX world that you should be aware of. G10 Currencies The G10 currencies are ten of the most heavily traded currencies in the world, which are also ten of the world’s most liquid currencies.

Country Currency Name Currency Code United States dollar USD European Union euro EUR United Kingdom pound GBP Japan yen JPY Australia dollar AUD New Zealand dollar NZD Canada dollar CAD Switzerland franc CHF Norway krone NOK Sweden krona SEK Denmark krone DKK The Scandies Scandinavia is a subregion in Northern Europe, with strong historical, cultural, and linguistic ties. The term “ Scandinavia ” in local usage covers the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Together, their currencies are known as the “ Scandies “. Back in the day, Denmark and Sweden established the Scandinavian Monetary Union to merge their currencies to a gold standard. Norway joined later. This meant that these countries now had one currency, with the same monetary value, with the exception that each of these countries minted its own coins. But then World War I happened, the gold standard was abandoned and the Scandinavian Monetary Union disbanded. These countries decided to keep the currency, even if the values were separate from one another. And this remains the state of things. If you notice their currency names, they all look similar. That’s because the word “krone or krona” literally means “crown”, and the differences in spelling of the name represent the differences between the North Germanic languages. Crown currencies. What a cool name huh? I don’t know about you, but saying “Hook me up with some crowns yo.” sounds way cooler than “Hook me up with some dollahs yo.” Country Currency Name Currency Code Denmark krone DKK Sweden krona SEK Norway krone NOK SEK and NOK also have cool nicknames, “ Stockie ” and “ Nokie “. So when paired with the U.S. dollar, USD/SEK is read “dollar stockie” and USD/NOK is read “dollar nockie”. CEE Currencies “ CEE ” stands for Central and Eastern Europe . Central and Eastern Europe is a term encompassing the countries in Central Europe, the Baltics , Eastern Europe , and Southeast Europe (the Balkans), usually meaning former communist states from the Eastern Bloc (Warsaw Pact) in Europe. Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) is an OECD term for the group of countries comprising Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

However, following Argentina’s change in government, it ultimately declined the invitation. As a result, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE joined the original BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), bringing the total to 10 members. In January 2025, Indonesia was officially admitted as a full member, expanding the group to 11 countries. The BRICS+ countries vary significantly in their economic and demographic impact, but their combined influence has grown substantially. The expanded BRICS+ group now represents approximately 46% of global GDP (adjusted for purchasing power) and about 54.6% of the world’s population. In addition to full members, BRICS introduced a “partner country” category in October 2024.
