There are three peaks in the formation: the central peak, referred to as the "head," and two flanking peaks of similar height, known as the "shoulders." As the pattern develops, a stock's price climbs to a peak, drops back to its prior base, advances to a higher peak (the "head"), and retreats once more before reaching a final peak at the initial shoulder level. This structure signals that an upward trend may be ending. Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou A head and shoulders pattern has four components: The first and third peaks are the shoulders, and the second peak forms the head. The line connecting the first and second troughs is called the neckline . The opposite of a head and shoulders chart is the inverse head and shoulders , also called a head and shoulders bottom. It is inverted, with the head and shoulders bottoms used to predict reversals in downtrends. This pattern is identified when the price action of a security meets the following characteristics: The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern reliably indicates a trend reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. Here, prices hit three lows with brief rallies in between. Of these, the second trough is the lowest (the head), and the first and third are slightly shallower (the shoulders). The final rally after the third dip signals that the bearish trend has reversed, and prices are likely to keep rallying upward. The head and shoulders pattern indicates that a reversal is possible. Traders use the pattern of three peaks and troughs, with a taller middle peak, to predict falling stock prices. The neckline is where bearish traders typically sell. The downtrend may continue until prices rise above the right shoulder's peak. Experienced traders identify it easily Defined profit and risk Big market movements can be profited from Can be used in all markets Novice traders might miss it Large stop loss distances possible Neckline can appear to move While traders agree that the pattern is a reliable indicator, there is no guarantee that the trend will reverse as indicated. The head and shoulders chart is said to depict a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal and signals that an upward trend is nearing its end. Investors consider it to be one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns. The most common entry point is a breakout of the neckline, with a stop above (market top) or below (market bottom) the right shoulder. The profit target is the difference between the high and low with the pattern added (market bottom) or subtracted (market top) from the breakout price. The system is not perfect, but it does provide a method of trading the markets based on logical price movements. An inverse head and shoulders, also called a "head and shoulders bottom," is similar to the standard head and shoulders pattern but inverted, with the head and shoulders top used to predict reversals in downtrends. It is a bearish-to-bullish indicator. The inverse head and shoulders pattern is the opposite of the head and shoulders, indicating a reversal from a bearish trend to a bullish trend. The head and shoulders is a pattern used by traders to identify price reversals. A bearish head and shoulders has three peaks, with the middle one reaching higher than the other two. It indicates a reversal of an upward trend. A bullish head and shoulders has three troughs, with the middle one reaching lower than the other two. It indicates a reversal of a downward trend.
