## Key Concepts

The cup and handle pattern, introduced by technician William J. O'Neil, is a bullish continuation pattern that traders use to identify potential buying opportunities in the market. It visually resembles a U-shaped cup with a downward-sloping handle on price charts. This pattern has been widely discussed in O'Neil's work, "How to Make Money in Stocks", and further detailed in articles from Investor’s Business Daily . Recognized as a signal for upward price movement, this pattern can form over a period ranging from seven to 65 weeks, with the potential for significant trading gains once the handle's resistance level is breached.

O'Neil defined the cup and handle (C&H) pattern in his 1988 classic, "How to Make Money in Stocks", adding technical requirements through a series of articles published in Investor’s Business Daily, which he founded in 1984. O'Neil included time frame measurements for each component, as well as a detailed description of the rounded lows that give the pattern its unique teacup appearance. As a stock tests old highs, it may face selling pressure from investors, causing a brief downtrend for four days to four weeks before moving higher. A cup and handle is considered a bullish continuation pattern and is used to identify buying opportunities. It is worth considering the following when detecting cup and handle patterns: While it's not necessary for the handle to reach previous highs, the further away it is, the stronger the breakout may need to be. There are several ways to approach trading the cup and handle , but the most basic is to look for entering a long position. The image below depicts a classic cup and handle formation. Place a stop buy order slightly above the upper trend line of the handle. Order execution should only occur if the price breaks the pattern’s resistance. Traders may experience excess slippage and enter a false breakout using an aggressive entry. Alternatively, you can wait for the price to close above the handle's upper trend line, then place a limit order just below the breakout level in case of a price retracement. There is a risk of missing the trade if the price continues to advance and does not pull back.

For example, if the distance between the bottom of the cup and handle breakout level is 20 points, a profit target is placed 20 points above the pattern's handle. You can place stop-loss orders below the handle or cup, based on your risk tolerance and market conditions. Now let's consider a real-world historical example using Wynn Resorts, Limited ( WYNN ), which went public on the Nasdaq exchange near $13 in October 2002 and rose to $154 five years later. The subsequent decline ended within two points of the initial public offering (IPO) price, far exceeding O'Neil's requirement for a shallow cup high in the prior trend. The subsequent recovery wave reached the prior high in 2011, nearly 10 years after the first print. The handle follows the classic pullback expectation, finding support at the 50% retracement in a rounded shape, and returns to the high for a second time 14 months later. The stock broke out in October 2013 and added 90 points in the following five months.

The cup and handle pattern has some limitations noted by experts. The first is that it can take some time for the pattern to fully form, which can lead to late decisions. Though a cup and handle typically forms within one month to one year, it can vary widely, making it ambiguous at times. Another issue has to do with the depth of the cup part of the formation. Sometimes a shallower cup can be a signal, while other times a deep cup can produce a false signal. Sometimes the cup forms without the characteristic handle. Additionally, like many technical patterns, it can be unreliable in illiquid stocks. A cup and handle is a technical indicator where the price movement of a security resembles a “cup” followed by a downward trending price pattern. This drop, or “handle” is meant to signal a buying opportunity to go long on a security. When this part of the price formation is over, the security may reverse course and reach new highs. Typically, cup and handle patterns fall between seven weeks to over a year. Consider a scenario where a stock has recently reached a high after significant momentum but has since corrected, falling almost 50%. At this point, an investor may purchase the stock, anticipating that it will bounce back to previous levels. The stock then rebounds, testing the previous high resistance levels, after which it falls into a sideways trend. In the final leg of the pattern, the stock exceeds these resistance levels, soaring 50% above the previous high. If a cup and handle forms and it is confirmed, the price should see a sharp increase in the short- to medium-term. If the pattern fails, this bull run would not be observed. The target with the cup and handle pattern is the height of the cup added to the breakout point of the handle. Generally, these patterns are bullish signals extending an uptrend. As a general rule, cup and handle patterns are bullish price formations. The founder of the term, William O’Neil, identified four primary stages of this technical trading pattern. First, approximately one to three months before the “cup” pattern begins, a security will reach a new high in an uptrend. Second, the security will retrace, dropping no more than 50% of the previous high creating a rounding bottom. Third, the security will rebound to its previous high, but subsequently decline, forming the “handle” part of the formation. Finally, the security breaks out again, surpassing its highs that are equal to the depth of the cup’s low point.
