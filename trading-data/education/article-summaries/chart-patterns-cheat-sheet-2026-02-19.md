## Key Concepts

Like we promised, here’s a neat little cheat sheet to help you remember all those chart patterns and what they are signaling. We’ve listed the basic classic chart patterns , when they are formed, what type of signal they give, and what the next likely price move may be. Check it out! Chart Pattern Forms During Type of Signal Next Move Double Top Uptrend Reversal Down Double Bottom Downtrend Reversal Up Head and Shoulders Uptrend Reversal Down Inverse Head and Shoulders Downtrend Reversal Up Rising Wedge Downtrend Continuation Down Rising Wedge Uptrend Reversal Down Falling Wedge Uptrend Continuation Up Falling Wedge Downtrend Reversal Up Bearish Rectangle Downtrend Continuation Down Bullish Rectangle Uptrend Continuation Up Bearish Pennant Downtrend Continuation Down Bullish Pennant Uptrend Continuation Up You also might want to add this page to your bookmarks in case you need to double-check those chart patterns’ signals before you risk your hard-earned cash on a trade. You never know when you’re gonna need to cheat, hah! Bookmark this thing yo! And as you probably noticed, we didn’t include the triangle formations (symmetrical, ascending, and descending) in this cheat sheet. That’s because these chart patterns can form either in an uptrend or downtrend , and can signal either a trend continuation or reversal . Confusing I know, but that’s where practice and experience come in! As we mentioned, it’s tough to tell where the price will break out or reverse. So what’s important is that you prepare well and have your entry/exit orders ready so that you can be part of the action either way!
