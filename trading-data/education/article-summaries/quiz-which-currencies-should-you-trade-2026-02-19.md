## Key Concepts

Each currency pair is unique. As Dr. Pipslow said about finding your trading niche , each set of currency pairs has its own behavioral tendencies that set it apart from the others. It is important to match your personality with the behaviors of the pairs you trade. We already talked about the majors, the comdolls, and the crosses in the What is Forex lesson of the School of Pipsology. Now here’s your chance to learn more about them and discover which suits your trading personality best. Take the results with a grain of salt. The results you get are just recommendations based on your answers and are meant to get you onto the right path. As you get better, keep an open mind to all new experiences and realities to help you evolve and grow your trading abilities.
