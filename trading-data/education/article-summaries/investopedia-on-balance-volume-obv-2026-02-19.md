## Key Concepts

On-balance volume (OBV), developed by Joseph Granville in 1963, is a pivotal technical trading indicator that leverages volume flow to anticipate stock price movements. Granville proposed that market volume is the driving force behind significant price shifts. His OBV metric aims to forecast when major market moves will occur based on changes in volume. According to Granville, when volume rises sharply without a corresponding price change, an eventual significant price movement is likely—either upward or downward—due to this 'spring being wound tightly' effect.

The OBV is a cumulative total of volume (positive and negative). There are three rules implemented when calculating the OBV. They are: 1. If today's closing price is higher than yesterday's closing price, then: Current OBV = Previous OBV + today's volume 2. If today's closing price is lower than yesterday's closing price, then: Current OBV = Previous OBV - today's volume 3. If today's closing price equals yesterday's closing price, then: Current OBV = Previous OBV The theory behind OBV is based on the distinction between smart money —namely, institutional investors—and less sophisticated retail investors. As mutual funds and pension funds begin to buy into an issue that retail investors are selling, volume may increase even as the price remains relatively level. Eventually, volume drives the price upward. At that point, larger investors begin to sell, and smaller investors begin buying. Although plotted on a price chart , the specific numerical value of OBV isn't important. The indicator itself is cumulative, while the time interval remains fixed by a dedicated starting point, meaning the real number value of OBV arbitrarily depends on the start date. Instead, traders focus on OBV movements over time; the slope of the OBV line is crucial for analysis. Analysts use OBV volumes to track large, institutional investors . They view divergences between volume and price as a sign of how "smart money" interacts with regular investors, hoping to spot opportunities against prevailing trends. For example, institutional money may drive up the price of an asset, then sell after other investors jump on the bandwagon. Below is a list of 10 days' worth of a hypothetical stock's closing price and volume: As can be seen, days two, three, six, seven and nine are up days, so these trading volumes are added to the OBV. Days four, five and 10 are down days, so these trading volumes are subtracted from the OBV. On day eight, no changes are made to the OBV since the closing price did not change. Given the days, the OBV for each of the 10 days is: On-balance volume and the accumulation/distribution line are similar in that they are both momentum indicators that use volume to predict the movement of “smart money”. However, this is their only similarity. In the case of on-balance volume, it is calculated by summing the volume on an up-day and subtracting the volume on a down-day. The formula used to create the accumulation/distribution (Acc/Dist) line is quite different than the OBV shown above. The formula for the Acc/Dist, without getting too complicated, is that it uses the position of the current price relative to its recent trading range and multiplies it by that period's volume. One limitation of OBV is that it is a leading indicator, meaning that it may produce predictions, but there is little it can say about what has actually happened in terms of the signals it produces. Because of this, it is prone to produce false signals. It can therefore be balanced by lagging indicators. Add a moving average line to the OBV to look for OBV line breakouts; you can confirm a breakout in the price if the OBV indicator makes a concurrent breakout. Another note of caution in using the OBV is that a large spike in volume on a single day can throw off the indicator for quite a while. For instance, a surprise earnings announcement, being added or removed from an index, or massive institutional block trades can cause the indicator to spike or plummet, but the spike in volume may not be indicative of a trend. Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average amount of shares traded each day for a given stock. It can be a useful metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders. Traders and investors can use ADTV to assess liquidity, analyze volatility, optimize trade execution, and manage risk. ADTV can be used alongside OBV and other indicators to evaluate the market's activity. Volume-Price Trend (VPT) is similar to on-balance volume in that it measures the cumulative volume and provides traders with information about a security’s money flow. But whereas OBV looks at volume just according to whether the close was higher or lower, VPT looks at how much higher or lower it was. This helps determine a security’s price direction and strength of price change. On-Balance Volume is a leading indicator: it produces predictions, but it doesn't provide specific information on exactly what happened or why. This can lead to wrong interpretations. OBV should be used alongside lagging indicators for better effectiveness. On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical indicator that measures positive and negative volume flow and analyzes the trading direction. It appears as a single line that helps investors make trading decisions and identify buy or sell points. However, OBV doesn't provide specific information about the financial asset, which can lead to misinterpretations. Therefore, traders should balance OBV by using lagging indicators.
