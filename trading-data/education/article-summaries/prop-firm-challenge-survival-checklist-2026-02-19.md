## Key Concepts

“ Risk manager first, trader second.” Passing a prop firm challenge isn’t about hitting lucky trades or chasing every market move…it’s about surviving long enough to let your edge play out. Most traders fail not because they lack strategy, but because they ignore risk management, overtrade, or gamble on volatility. Read our lesson, “ The 5 Deadly O’s of Trading: What Traders Do To Guarantee Their Own Failure “ This Prop Firm Challenge Survival Checklist distills the habits of successful traders into clear, actionable rules you can keep by your side. Follow these steps, and you’ll give yourself the best chance not just to pass, but to build a long-term funded trading career. 🛡 Risk Management First ⬜ Always set a stop-loss and take-profit before entering. ⬜ Risk no more than 1% per trade (adjust dynamically to stop size). ⬜ If in drawdown, cut risk in half until recovered. ⬜ Respect daily loss limits. Never risk the full daily max on one trade. 🎯 Trade Selection ⬜ If you’re bold enough to day trade or scalp, take 2–3 high-quality trades/day max. ⬜ Only trade setups that match your plan (don’t chase randomness). ⬜ Avoid entering directly on news releases (CPI, NFP, FOMC). ⬜ Trade during high-volume sessions (London, NY open) for cleaner moves. ⏳ Patience & Duration ⬜ Hold trades as planned. Don’t scalp out early. ⬜ Swing trading setups are often more consistent than reckless scalping. ⬜ Survive long enough. It often takes longer to pass than to fail . 🚫 Avoid Common Pitfalls ⬜ No overtrading (7–9 trades/day = guaranteed failure). ⬜ Don’t stick to fixed lot sizes. Use a position size calculator and size according to stop loss distance. ⬜ Don’t widen stops or remove them! Hope is not a strategy. 💡 Mindset Rules ⬜ Treat the account like a long-term business , not a lottery ticket. ⬜ Survive first, profit second. ⬜ Consistency > excitement. Boring trading often passes. ⬜ When unsure, do nothing. Flat is a position. 🔑 Golden Formula You’ve probably seen the classic advice: “Get a 50% win rate, use a 2:1 risk-reward ratio, and you’ll pass any prop challenge.” It sounds clean. Simple. Easy to remember. But it’s only one path among many. The Problem With the “50% + 2:1” Rule This formula has led countless traders astray because they think these specific numbers are requirements. They force trades to hit a 2:1 ratio. They beat themselves up when their win rate dips to 45%. They abandon good strategies because the metrics don’t match the “golden” numbers. The reality? Some of the most successful prop traders have: 35% win rates (trend followers) 65% win rates (scalpers) Risk-reward ratios ranging from 1.5:1 to 5:1 So what actually matters? Positive expectancy! Here’s the only formula that actually determines your success: Expectancy = (Win Rate × Average Win) - (Loss Rate × Average Loss) If this number is positive, you make money. If it’s negative, you lose money. Period. Let’s See This in Action Example 1: The “Classic” Approach Win Rate: 50% Loss Rate: 50% Average Win: $200 (2:1 RR) Average Loss: $100 Expectancy = (0.50 × $200) – (0.50 × $100) = $50 per trade ✅ Example 2: The Trend Follower Win Rate: 35% Loss Rate: 65% Average Win: $400 (4:1 RR) Average Loss: $100 Expectancy = (0.35 × $400) – (0.65 × $100) = $75 per trade ✅ Example 3: The Mean Reversion Scalper Win Rate: 65% Loss Rate: 35% Average Win: $120 (1.5:1 RR) Average Loss: $80 Expectancy = (0.65 × $120) – (0.35 × $80) = $50 per trade ✅ All three work. None is “better” than the others. They’re just different trading styles with positive expectancy. The REAL “Golden Formula” (Positive Expectancy) × (Strict Risk Control) × (Consistency) = Prop Challenge Success Let’s break it down: 1. Positive Expectancy Your wins must mathematically outweigh your losses over time. This can be achieved through: High win rate + smaller winners (mean reversion, scalping). Low win rate + larger winners (trend following, breakouts). Moderate win rate + moderate risk-reward (swing trading, supply/demand). 2. Strict Risk Control This is non-negotiable. No matter your win rate or risk-reward ratio, you MUST: Risk only 0.5-1% per trade in the early stages. Never exceed 2% per trade, even when confident. Keep total drawdown well below the challenge limit (aim for 50% of max allowed). 3. Consistency Execute your edge repeatedly without deviation. Don’t chase losses or overtrade after wins. Follow your plan even during losing streaks. Find YOUR Winning Combination Stop trying to force a 50% win rate with 2:1 risk-reward if that’s not your natural trading style. Instead, ask yourself: What’s my trading style ? (Scalping? Swing trading? Trend following?) What’s my realistic win rate? (Track 50+ trades to find out) What’s my average risk-reward? (Based on market structure, not arbitrary targets) Do these numbers create positive expectancy? Then build your risk management around those numbers. Key Takeaway There is no single “golden formula” for prop trading success. The real golden formula is positive expectancy plus disciplined risk management. And those can be achieved through countless combinations. The 50% win rate with 2:1 risk-reward is a perfectly valid approach. But so is 40% with 3:1. And 60% with 1.5:1. And 35% with 4:1. Find what works for YOUR trading style, prove it has positive expectancy, and protect your account with ironclad risk management. That’s the formula that actually works. Good luck!
