## Key Concepts

In the previous lesson, we explored how central bank balance sheet changes affect stocks, bonds, and overall market liquidity. But there’s another massive market where these balance sheet dynamics play out with equal force: foreign exchange . The global currency market trades over $9.6 trillion daily , more than all stock markets combined! Central bank balance sheets are arguably more important for forex traders than for equity traders, because currency values are directly determined by the relative supply and scarcity of money itself. This lesson focuses exclusively on how balance sheet expansion and contraction drive currency movements . Whether you’re trading EUR/USD, hedging dollar exposure, or simply trying to understand why your international stocks gained or lost money last quarter, you need to understand the relationship between a central bank’s balance sheet and its currency. We’ll cover: The fundamental mechanism : how QE weakens currencies, and QT strengthens them. Historical case studies from 2008 to 2025 showing dramatic currency moves. Relative balance sheet policies : why EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and other pairs move. Emerging market currency dynamics and the carry trade. The dollar-gold relationship and how to trade it. Practical frameworks for positioning currency trades around balance sheet changes. By the end, you’ll understand why the dollar crashed 13.6% during 2020-2021 QE, rallied 28% during 2022 QT, and what to expect as the Fed’s balance sheet enters its next phase. How Balance Sheet Changes Affect Currencies The Currency Impact: Why the Dollar Moves Central bank balance sheet changes don’t just affect stocks and bonds. They have huge effects on currency values . Understanding these dynamics is crucial whether you’re a forex trader or simply holding USD-denominated assets. The fundamental principle: When a central bank expands its balance sheet, it increases the supply of its currency. More supply = Lower value (all else equal). When it contracts the balance sheet, it reduces supply = Higher value. But the real world is more complex because all currencies are relative . The dollar trades against the euro, yen, pound, etc. What matters most is the relative balance sheet policy between central banks. Fed QE = Dollar Weakness (Usually) The mechanism during QE: Supply expansion: Fed creates new dollars (reserves) to buy assets. Lower yields: Treasury purchases push US yields down. Reduced carry: Lower yields make the USD less attractive to foreign investors. Capital outflow: Money flows out of dollar assets seeking better returns abroad. Dollar weakens: Increased supply + reduced demand = Lower DXY. Historical evidence: QE1-QE3 (2008-2014): Fed balance sheet: $900B → $4.5T (5x increase). DXY: Started around 88, fell to the low-80s by 2011, recovered to mid-80s by 2014. Pattern: Initial dollar weakness during peak QE, then stabilization. QE4 – COVID Response (2020-2021): Fed balance sheet: $4.2T → $8.96T (+$4.76T). DXY: Spiked to 103 in March 2020 (crisis flight-to-safety), then fell to 89 by January 2021. Decline: -13.6% from peak to trough. This was textbook QE currency debasement. Why the dollar weakened dramatically in 2020-2021: Unprecedented money printing ($4.76T in assets purchased). Zero interest rates (no carry advantage for USD). Fiscal stimulus is adding to the dollar supply via deficit spending. The global economy is recovering, reducing safe-haven demand. Asset implications: Dollar weakness during QE amplifies returns for US investors in: International stocks (EAFE, emerging markets). Commodities (priced in USD, so weak dollar = higher commodity prices). Gold and precious metals (traditional dollar hedges). Foreign currency positions. Fed QT = Dollar Strength (Usually) The mechanism during QT: Supply reduction: Fed lets bonds mature, removing dollars from circulation. Higher yields: Reduced Fed buying allows Treasury yields to rise. Increased carry: Higher yields attract foreign capital to USD assets. Capital inflow: Money flows into dollars seeking superior returns. Dollar strengthens: Reduced supply + increased demand = Higher DXY. Historical evidence: 2022 QT Period: Fed balance sheet: Peak $8.96T → $6.58T by late 2025 (-$2.39T). DXY: 89 (January 2022) → 114 (September 2022). Rally: +28% in just 9 months. One of the strongest dollar rallies in decades. Why the dollar surged so dramatically: Fed removing liquidity via QT. Fed hiking rates aggressively (0% → 5.25-5.50%). Other central banks slower to tighten (policy divergence). Global recession fears driving safe-haven flows. Europe facing energy crisis, making the USD relatively more attractive. Asset implications: Dollar strength during QT creates headwinds for US investors in: International stocks (currency translation losses). Commodities (a strong dollar makes commodities more expensive globally). Emerging market assets (EM currencies typically fall when the USD strengthens). Gold (inverse relationship with DXY). For forex traders: The 2022 dollar rally created massive opportunities: Long USD/JPY: From 115 to 151 (+31%) Long USD/EUR: From 1.15 to parity 1.00 (+13%) Long USD/GBP: From 1.35 to 1.03 (+24%) The Critical Exception: Crisis = Dollar Strength Despite QE Not all QE weakens the dollar immediately. During acute crises, the dollar can surge even as the Fed expands its balance sheet because of safe-haven demand . March 2020 example: March 23: Fed announces unlimited QE. DXY: Spiked from 95 to 103 (+8%) during the QE announcement period. Why? Global dollar shortage as everyone scrambled for USD liquidity. The sequence: Phase 1 (Crisis week 1-2): Dollar surges as global panic creates dollar shortage. Phase 2 (Crisis week 3-8): Dollar peaks as Fed floods system with liquidity. Phase 3 (Post-crisis months 3-12): Dollar weakens as QE effects dominate. Don’t blindly short USD when QE is announced during a crisis. Wait for safe-haven flows to reverse first (typically 2-4 weeks after peak panic). Relative Balance Sheet Changes: The Key to Forex Trading Currency pairs trade on relative monetary policy . What matters isn’t just what the Fed is doing. It’s what the Fed is doing compared to other central banks . The forex trader’s framework: Fed Policy ECB Policy Effect on EUR/USD Logic QE expanding QE expanding Depends on magnitude Whoever prints more = weaker currency QE expanding QT contracting EUR strengthens ECB removing euros, Fed adding dollars QT contracting QT contracting Depends on magnitude Whoever tightens more = stronger currency QT contracting QE expanding USD strengthens Fed removing dollars, ECB adding euros Stable QE expanding USD strengthens ECB adding supply, Fed not QE expanding Stable EUR strengthens Fed adding supply, ECB not Real-World Examples of Relative Balance Sheet Moves Example 1: 2020-2021 Coordinated QE What happened: Fed: Added $4.76T (113% increase) ECB: Added €1.85T via PEPP BOJ: Increased purchases to ¥12T/year Everyone printed simultaneously Currency effect: EUR/USD is relatively stable (both expanding similarly). USD/JPY is relatively stable (both expanding). DXY fell overall because commodity currencies (AUD, CAD, BRL) surged as their central banks printed less aggressively When all major central banks expand together, look to emerging market and commodity currencies for the best long opportunities (they benefit from global liquidity without printing as much themselves). Example 2: 2022-2024 Divergent Policies What happened: Fed: Aggressive QT + rapid rate hikes ECB: Slower to tighten, continued APP for longer BOJ: Maintained QE and YCC until March 2024 PBoC: Actually easing (counter-cyclical) Currency effect: EUR/USD: Fell from 1.15 to parity (Fed tightening faster) USD/JPY: Surged from 115 to 151 (massive policy divergence) USD/CNY: Rose from 6.35 to 7.35 (China easing while US tightening) Trading lesson: The most profitable forex trades come from divergence . When central banks move in opposite directions, currency trends can last 12-24 months. Example 3: 2024-2025 Historic Divergence Current policy split: BOJ: Tightening (QT ¥3T/month + rate hikes). Fed: Pausing (QT ending December 2025, rates on hold). ECB: Slow cuts (rates down but QT continues). PBoC: Easing (RRR cuts, targeted lending). Currency effect so far: JPY strengthening as BOJ normalizes (USD/JPY from 151 peak to 140s). EUR mixed (conflicting signals from slow cuts + continued QT). CNY supported by easing, but the property crisis creates headwinds. USD relatively stable as Fed pauses. Balance Sheet Effects on Emerging Market Currencies EM currencies show amplified sensitivity to Fed balance sheet changes because: Dollar funding dependence: Many EM economies borrow in USD. Commodity links: EM currencies tied to commodity prices (which move inversely to USD). Risk appetite proxy: EM = “risk-on” trade that follows global liquidity. Relative yield importance: EM offers higher yields that become more/less attractive as Fed policy shifts. During Fed QE (dollar weakness): EM currencies surge (BRL, MXN, ZAR, TRY gain 20-40%). Capital flows into emerging markets seeking higher yields. Commodities rally (weak USD), benefiting commodity-exporting EM economies. EM central banks often ease in response, supporting growth. During Fed QT (dollar strength): EM currencies crash (can lose 20-50% in severe episodes). Capital flees emerging markets back to USD safety. Commodities fall (strong USD), hurting commodity exporters. EM central banks forced to raise rates to defend currencies. Historical examples: 2013 “Taper Tantrum”: Fed merely discussed slowing QE Result: EM currencies crashed, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa hit hard. Indian rupee fell 20%, the Indonesian rupiah fell 15%. 2020-2021 QE: Fed printed $4.76T BRL: Strengthened from 5.90 to 4.90 against USD (+17%). MXN: Strengthened from 25 to 19.5 against USD (+22%). ZAR: Strengthened from 19 to 14 against USD (+26%). 2022 QT: Fed removed $1T+ BRL: Weakened from 4.90 to 5.70 (-14%). MXN: Weakened from 19.5 to 20.5 (-5%, relatively resilient). TRY: Collapsed from 13 to 28 (-54%, compounded by domestic crisis). For EM forex traders: Use the Fed balance sheet as a primary risk-on/risk-off signal. Long EM currencies early in QE cycles (front-run the capital flows). Exit EM currencies when Fed signals tightening (don’t wait for QT to start). Focus on EM countries with strong fundamentals during QT (they suffer least). Carry Trade Dynamics and Balance Sheets Carry trades (borrowing low-yield currencies to invest in high-yield currencies) are deeply influenced by balance sheet policy. The mechanism: When the Fed expands its balance sheet: USD interest rates fall (zero rates during QE). Carry attractiveness falls (why hold USD if it yields nothing?). Investors borrow USD to fund high-yield currency positions (AUD, NZD, MXN). This creates sustained USD weakness and EM/commodity currency strength. When the Fed contracts its balance sheet: USD interest rates rise (5.25% during QT). Carry becomes attractive (positive yield on USD). Investors unwind carry trades (buy back USD to repay loans). This creates sustained USD strength and EM/commodity currency weakness. Popular carry trade pairs: During Fed QE (borrow USD, buy high-yielders): Short USD/Long AUD (Australian dollar has high rates, commodity-linked). Short USD/Long NZD (New Zealand dollar similar to AUD). Short USD/Long MXN (Mexican peso offers high yields). Short JPY/Long BRL (Brazil offers the highest yields, JPY the lowest). During Fed QT (carry unwinds): All these trades reverse violently. USD-funded carry trades get massacred in QT environments. 2022 example: USD/MXN from 19.5 → 20.5 killed many carry positions. For carry traders: Fed balance sheet direction determines the viability of USD-funded carry trades. Expanding balance sheet = Favorable carry environment (borrow USD). Contracting balance sheet = Hostile carry environment (avoid or reverse). Gold and Currencies: The Dollar-Gold Inverse Relationship Gold and the dollar typically move inversely because: Dollar-denomination: Gold priced in USD, so weak USD = mechanically higher gold price. Store of value competition: Both gold and USD are seen as safe havens/reserves. Real rates: Fed balance sheet expansion usually coincides with low/negative real rates (bullish for gold). Debasement narrative: Gold benefits from the “currency debasement” narrative during QE. The correlation is strong but imperfect: During Fed QE: Expected: Dollar falls, gold rises ✓ 2008-2011: DXY fell from 88 → 73, gold rose from $800 → $1,920 (+140%) 2020-2021: DXY fell from 103 → 89, gold rose from $1,480 → $2,070 (+40%) During Fed QT: Expected: Dollar rises, gold falls ✓ 2022: DXY rose from 89 → 114, gold fell from $2,070 → $1,620 (-22%) 2024: DXY stable around 104-106, gold at record highs $2,300+ (divergence!) The 2024 exception proves the rule: Gold rallied despite a stable/strong dollar because: Central bank buying (especially China, Russia, India) offset dollar strength Geopolitical risk (Ukraine, Middle East) increased gold demand Real rates fell (inflation fears despite Fed pause) For gold traders: Use the Fed balance sheet + DXY together for the best signal. QE + Falling DXY =
