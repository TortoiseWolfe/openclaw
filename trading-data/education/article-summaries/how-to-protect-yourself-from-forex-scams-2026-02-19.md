I will not succumb to guaranteed returns! Lastly, I will not be lazy and let someone else trade me lucky charms *cough* I mean my money for me!” Now that we have that over with, let’s close out with some questions our viewers have asked us countless times! Q: How can I protect myself from fraud? A: Easy. Be educated. Be smart. Know what a scam looks like. Anything that seems too good to be true usually really isn’t true. Q: How do I choose a forex broker? A: First and foremost, make sure the broker is regulated by a national agency. DYOR. Research, research, and do more research! Q: Can forex managed accounts be trusted? A: If your forex manager is yourself, yes! If not, I’d exercise extreme caution. But if you’re persistent and want to find out the hard way, do a background check and make sure the person has proper licenses and certifications. You should find out if the person’s forex activities are regulated and by whom. If the person is not regulated, you may be exposed to additional risks. Q: Are forex robots profitable? A: It’s possible, but because they’re usually built for a specific set of conditions, their profitability, and how long it may be profitable depends on the market. Like human traders, they can go on long profitable runs, have a long string of losing trades in a row, or see-saw somewhere in-between. If you take anything away from the school about them, just don’t think they’re a “set-and-forget” solution to trading; they must be monitored closely as well. Q: Who do I contact if I suspect fraud?
