## Key Concepts

Japanese candlesticks are a popular charting technique used in technical analysis to analyze price action and guess probable price movements. And now that you’ve discovered Japanese candlesticks, you’re ready to conquer the markets, huh? Well, pump the brakes for a sec, because while they can be a powerful tool for traders, new traders often make common mistakes when using Japanese candlesticks. Let’s face it, we’ve all been there…staring at candlestick charts, thinking we’ve cracked the code, only to make a trade and watch our money vanish faster than free pizza at a college dorm. But don’t worry! We’re about to dive into some of the most common slip-ups that newbie traders make when they’re first getting cozy with Japanese candlesticks. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be dodging these rookie mistakes like a pro and be well on your way to candlestick mastery. Here are some common mistakes that new traders often make when using Japanese candlesticks . 1. You try to find meaning in EVERY candlestick that appears on the chart. A lot of the time, markets are “noisy.” Not every candlestick is useful when thinking about future price movements. Instead of looking at every candlestick, focus on the ones where the price is currently trading near important support and resistance levels . So first identify where you think these levels are, and then start looking out for candlestick patterns. 2. Your imagination is too strong. If you have to zoom in 500% or squint at the Japanese candlestick chart because you think “You see something”, there’s probably nothing there. You don’t have to try and assign a textbook label to candlestick formations you see. Focus on finding evidence of strong buying pressure when you expect to buy , and evidence of strong selling pressure when you expect selling . 3. Your imagination is too weak. Japanese candlestick patterns that are supposed to form after three candles based on textbook examples may actually end up forming over five candles. Just because a three-candlestick pattern takes four candlesticks to form doesn’t invalidate the pattern. The meaning is still the same. It’s more important to understand the price action behind the candlestick pattern than to simply memorize its standard form. 4. You forget the forest from the trees. If you constantly just focus on shorter time frames like 5-minute charts without stepping back and trying to look at the “bigger picture”, your trades will tend to get blindsided. Try not to make your focus too narrow. 5. You don’t wait for confirmation. There are some candlestick patterns that are considered “self-confirming”, but many are not. Make sure to wait until the candlestick closes and is fully formed before acting on a pattern. Always wait for the right confirmation that the price is moving in the direction you’re expecting. For example, if you see a Tweezer Bottom , it’s more prudent to wait and make sure that the candlestick after the dual candlestick pattern closes higher before going long.
