# Escape from Mos Eisley

**Type:** One-shot (can expand to 2-3 sessions)
**Players:** 2-4
**Era:** Classic trilogy (a few months after the Battle of Yavin)
**Tone:** Pulp adventure, heist elements, cantina chaos

## Hook
The players are smugglers, bounty hunters, or Rebel sympathizers stuck in Mos Eisley when the Empire locks down the spaceport. An Imperial officer is searching for stolen data — and the players either have it, are accused of having it, or need to get it before the Empire does.

## Map Descriptions

The overlay shows a top-down map to viewers. Use these descriptions to reference specific
locations when narrating — tell players WHERE things are happening on the map.

### cantina.svg — Chalmun's Cantina
- **Entrance** (bottom center): Main door to the street. Stormtroopers enter here.
- **Bar** (center-left, large U-shape): Wuher the bartender. 10 stools along both sides. Bottles and glasses on the counter — can be smashed or thrown.
- **Band Stage** (top-left alcove): Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes play here. Slightly raised platform — anyone can climb up, but it's conspicuous (everyone sees you) and a dead end (no exit, walls on three sides). A character could hide behind the band's equipment cases or cause a distraction by jumping on stage.
- **Booth 1** (upper-right): Nearest to back door. The hooded figure (Rodian contact) sits here. Each booth seats 2-3 characters — U-shaped bench with a table. Good cover during a fight (flip the table for +1D cover).
- **Booth 2** (middle-right): Occupied by a Devaronian and a Twi'lek. Same 2-3 person capacity. Good cover during a fight.
- **Booth 3** (lower-right): Empty at start. Near the storage room entrance. Same capacity.
- **Round tables** (center column, 3 tables): Open area between bar and booths. No cover — exposed during combat.
- **Storage room** (bottom-right): Door locked from outside (Security check difficulty 10, or take Wuher's keycard — he keeps it on a chain behind the bar). Inside: stacked crates of Corellian whiskey (bottles make improvised weapons — 2D stun, or throw for distraction), spare blaster power packs (2 charges each), a crate of droid parts (useful for Tok-3 repairs), and a hidden smuggler's compartment under the floor (Moderate Search, difficulty 15 — contains 200 credits and a holdout blaster). Back door to the alley accessible through here (separate lock — Security check difficulty 12).
- **Back door** (top-right wall): Quick exit to the alley behind the cantina. The Rodian runs for this.
- **Ambient lighting**: Dim — glow spots around the bar, center tables, band stage, and booth area.

### mos-eisley-streets.svg — Mos Eisley Streets
- **Main road** (horizontal, middle): Wide street running east-west. Open and exposed — Imperial patrols pass frequently. Two speeders parked at the center intersection: a larger one (Moderate Mechanical 15 to hotwire, seats 4) and a smaller, faster one (Easy Mechanical 10, seats 2).
- **Cross street** (vertical, center): Runs north-south, intersecting the main road. Open and exposed — connects the building blocks. Vaporators along the edges provide partial cover.
- **Cantina** (top-right block): Chalmun's Cantina entrance faces south toward the main road. Street outside is a gathering point.
- **Imperial Checkpoint** (bottom-right): Stormtroopers with barricades blocking the road to Docking Bay 87. Scanner equipment checks IDs. 2-4 troopers on duty. Barricades provide +2D cover if players get behind them. The checkpoint can be bypassed via the rooftop route, the alley, or the warehouse.
- **Shop** (top-left block, west): General goods — rope, glow rods, ration packs (50 credits each). Back room locked (Security 12) — 3 thermal detonators under the counter (500 credits each). Street frontage faces the main road.
- **Dwelling** (top-left block, center): Occupied family home. Banging on the door gets no answer. Moderate Persuasion to convince them to help.
- **Inn** (top-left block, east): Lobby on ground floor (20 credits/night, innkeeper asks no questions). Upstairs room is a safe hiding spot — window overlooks cross street, good sniper position. Rooftop accessible from room window (Climbing difficulty 10) — overlooks the whole intersection.
- **Junk Dealer** (top-right block, east of cantina): Toydarian owner haggles everything. Front counter for legitimate sales. Back room has fake IDs (Difficult Forgery 25, 300 credits), comlink jammers (150 credits), and speeder parts.
- **Market** (bottom-left): Open-air stalls in a 2x2 grid. NW stall: Jawa selling scrap electronics. NE stall: food vendor (skewered meats, blue milk). SW stall: cloth and cloaks (disguise material). SE stall: Jawa tool dealer (hydrospanners, fuses). Center is crowded (+1D cover for sneaking). Behind the stalls is out of sight from the road.
- **Warehouse** (far bottom-left): Locked (Security 15). Inside: crates of Imperial supplies and a stolen manifest. Alley entrance on the east side connects to the narrow alley. Rooftop accessible from alley side (Climbing 15) — overlooks the checkpoint from behind, excellent tactical position.
- **Narrow alley** (left side, running south): Tight passage, only 2 people wide. Ambush territory — the Trandoshan bounty hunter hides here. Recessed doorway alcove provides a hiding spot (Sneak +1D). South end emerges behind the warehouse. Connects to warehouse alley as a bypass for the main road.
- **Rooftop route** (above top building blocks): Accessible from inn rooftop. Climbing 15 to get up, Dexterity 15 to jump between buildings. Drops down near the cantina or junk dealer on the east side. Bypasses the road entirely — avoids checkpoint and patrols.
- **Docking Bay 87 direction** (far right): Road leads east off the map toward Bay 87, past the Imperial checkpoint.

### docking-bay-87.svg — Docking Bay 87
- **Blast door** (bottom center): Main entrance — heavy durasteel. Can be closed to seal the bay (Mechanical 20 to drop it on the AT-ST, or Strength to manual override). Partial cover from the doorframe on both sides.
- **Side entry** (left wall): Personnel entrance, less guarded. Locked from outside (Security 10). Leads to an alley — possible escape route or flanking approach.
- **The Rusty Mynock** (center): YT-1300 freighter. Needs Starship Repair 15 before it can fly. Key positions: boarding ramp (south), cockpit (starboard — Astrogation 15 to plot hyperspace), top hatch (Climbing 10 to reach, alternate entry bypassing the ramp), bow between mandibles (exposed but good firing angle on blast door), stern engine section (Repair 15 to jury-rig engine boost). Landing struts on port and starboard sides — duck under the hull for cover.
- **Dorsal turret** (top of ship): Quad laser cannon — Starship Gunnery 4D+2 damage, but needs Repair 12 to restore power first. Game-changer if someone can get it online during the assault.
- **Left cargo cluster** (upper-left): Crates provide +2D cover. Can be pushed to block doorways (Strength 15). Behind the crates: a dead Rebel pilot's body with a datapad containing Bay 94 codes. On top of the crates: elevated position (Climbing 10, +1D elevation bonus, but exposed).
- **Right cargo cluster** (upper-right): Imperial supply crates — 4 E-11 blaster rifles and 2 medpacs inside. Behind the crates: +2D cover, good sniper position toward the blast door. On top: same elevation bonus as left side.
- **Fuel barrels** (lower-left, marked red): 3 barrels of volatile fuel. EXPLOSIVE — shoot to detonate (6D damage, 5-meter radius). Can also be rolled toward the blast door as an improvised trap. Taking cover behind the barrels is possible but extremely dangerous if they're hit.
- **Maintenance pit** (center-right): Recessed area — characters inside are hidden from ground-level fire. Tool rack inside: hydrospanner, welding torch (3D melee weapon), plasma cutter (can cut through doors). Essential for ship repairs from below.
- **Control panel** (upper wall, center): Bay systems — blast door override, lights kill switch, comms panel. Computer Programming 10 to operate. Killing the lights gives advantage to defenders who know the layout.
- **Catwalks** (upper level, both sides): Elevated walkways along the walls. +1D high ground bonus for shooting. Ladders at each end (Climbing 5, takes 1 round to climb). Left catwalk has a ladder at the west end, right catwalk at the east end.
- **Bay floor** (open areas): Left side, right side, and center between ship and door. No cover anywhere on the open floor. The center becomes a kill zone during the Imperial assault.
- **AT-ST approach zone** (bottom, marked red dashed): Where the AT-ST walker enters. Clear line of fire to the ship — anyone on the open floor is in extreme danger during the climax.

## Act 1: The Lockdown

**Opening scene:** Players are in Chalmun's Cantina when Imperial Stormtroopers burst in. An officer (Lt. Draven Hask) announces a spaceport lockdown — no ships leave until the Empire finds "stolen Imperial intelligence."

**What happens:**
- Stormtroopers begin checking IDs and searching patrons
- The cantina band stops playing. Tension rises.
- A Rodian at the bar slides a data chip to one of the players and whispers: "Hold this. Don't let them find it. Docking Bay 87. Sunset." Then he bolts for the back door.
- Stormtroopers open fire on the Rodian. He goes down.

**Player choices:**
- Hide the chip (Moderate Con or Sneak check, difficulty 15)
- Fight their way out (combat encounter: 4 Stormtroopers)
- Bluff the officer (Difficult Con check, difficulty 20)
- Slip out the back (Easy Sneak check, difficulty 10, but the back alley has 2 more troopers)

## Act 2: Across Mos Eisley

**Goal:** Get to Docking Bay 87 before sunset.

**Complications (pick 2-3):**
1. **Jawa Market:** A Jawa trader offers to hide them in a sandcrawler for 300 credits. It works, but the sandcrawler breaks down halfway and they have to fix it (Moderate Droid/Starship Repair, difficulty 15).
2. **Bounty Hunter:** A Trandoshan bounty hunter is also after the data chip. He ambushes them in a narrow alley. Can be fought, bribed (500 credits), or outwitted (Difficult Perception check to spot his trap first).
3. **Imperial Checkpoint:** Main road blocked by troopers and a scanning station. Options: fake IDs (Very Difficult Forgery, 25), distraction (Moderate Con, 15), or rooftop route (Moderate Climbing, 15 + Moderate Dexterity, 15 to jump between buildings).
4. **Informant:** A Gran named Ploovo offers to lead them through the underground tunnels — but he's an Imperial informant. Perceptive players (Difficult Perception, 20) notice his hidden comlink.

## Wrong-Bay Encounters (Act 2 Side Content)

The docking bay complex has four visible bays. Only Bay 87 is the correct
destination. Players who explore the wrong bay waste precious time (sunset
is approaching) but may find useful items or dangerous encounters.

**Docking Bay 94** — Imperial impound. 4 Stormtroopers posted at the
entrance. Inside: a seized Corellian freighter with engine clamps
(Mechanical 25 to remove). Ship theft is Very Difficult and triggers an
immediate garrison alert (8 more troopers arrive in 3 rounds). The bay has
heavy crates for cover (+2D) but the troopers have elevated positions on
catwalks. Not worth the fight unless players are desperate.

**Docking Bay 86** — A smuggler's YT-2000 is being loaded by 2 Rodian crew
members. They're hostile to strangers but can be bribed (500 credits or
Moderate Persuasion 15 to negotiate passage). Ship theft is Difficult — the
Rodians will fight back (Blaster 4D each) and the ship needs Astrogation
codes that only they have (encrypted datapad in the cockpit, Computer
Programming 20 to crack). If befriended, the Rodians share gossip: "Bay 87
has a YT-1300 nobody's claimed. Owner was a Rodian who got himself shot
in the cantina."

**Docking Bay 92** — Empty. A maintenance droid (MSE-6) sweeps the floor in
endless circles. No ship, no guards, nothing useful. The bay is safe to
explore but searching it costs 10-15 minutes of in-game time. A Perception
check (difficulty 10) reveals scratches on the floor suggesting a ship
departed recently. Dead end — but at least it's quiet.

**Docking Bay 87** — The correct destination. Blast door is unlocked. A
faded sign reads "BAY 87" in Aurebesh. Inside: the *Rusty Mynock* (YT-1300),
the dead Rodian's ship. Connects to the `docking-bay-87.svg` interior map
for the Act 3 climax.

### Wayfinding

Players have limited information: the dying Rodian whispered "Docking Bay 87.
Sunset." Finding the right bay requires exploration or help:

- **Directional sign** at the west end of the main road: "DOCKING BAYS 86-94"
  with an arrow pointing toward the bay complex (upper-left of the overview).
- **Ithorian dockworker** near the main intersection: gives Bay 87 directions
  for 10 credits or Easy Persuasion 10. "Bay 87? Third door on the left past
  the impound yard. Watch out for the troopers at Bay 94."
- **Sign at Bay 87**: Faded Aurebesh above the blast door. Below in Basic:
  "Authorized Personnel Only."

If players head to a wrong bay first, let them learn from the encounter —
the Rodians at Bay 86 can point them to Bay 87, and the troopers at Bay 94
make it obvious they're in the wrong place.

## Act 3: Docking Bay 87

**The ship:** A beat-up YT-1300 (yes, that model) called the *Rusty Mynock*. Its owner is dead — the Rodian from the cantina was the pilot.

**The problem:** The ship needs repairs before it can fly (Moderate Starship Repair, 15). While they work, Lt. Hask arrives with 8 Stormtroopers and an AT-ST walker.

**Climax options:**
- **Fight:** Hold off Stormtroopers while someone repairs the ship. AT-ST is tough (Body 4D, Blasters 4D damage). Use fuel barrels as cover (or explosives).
- **Talk:** Hask can be reasoned with if players discover he's secretly sympathetic to the Rebellion (Very Difficult Persuasion, 25, or if they found evidence in the data chip).
- **Trick:** Lure the AT-ST into the docking bay and drop the blast door on it (Difficult Mechanical, 20 + Moderate Strength to pull the manual override).
- **Escape in chaos:** A Rebel cell creates a diversion elsewhere. If players signaled them earlier (comlink from the Rodian), X-wings strafe the Imperial position and they have 30 seconds to launch.

**Resolution:** Players escape to hyperspace with the data chip. It contains plans for an Imperial weapons test on the planet Onderon — setting up the next adventure.
