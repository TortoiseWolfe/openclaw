# Shadows of Onderon

**Type:** One-shot (can expand to 2-3 sessions)
**Players:** 2-4
**Era:** Classic trilogy (weeks after "Escape from Mos Eisley")
**Tone:** Jungle infiltration, moral choices, ancient ruins
**Prerequisite:** Escape from Mos Eisley (players have the stolen data chip)

## Hook
The data chip from Mos Eisley revealed Imperial plans for a weapons test on the jungle world of Onderon. A Rebel contact asks the players to investigate — and sabotage whatever the Empire is building. But Onderon has its own problems: a resistance movement, ancient Sith ruins, and a population caught between loyalty and survival.

## Act 1: Jungle Landing

**Opening scene:** The Rusty Mynock drops out of hyperspace above Onderon. The planet is lush green and blue below, but Imperial Star Destroyers orbit in pairs. Sneaking past requires a Difficult Starship Piloting check (difficulty 20). Failure doesn't mean capture — a patrol spots them and they have to outrun TIE fighters to the surface (chase scene: 3 rounds, Moderate piloting each round, difficulty 15).

**On the ground:** They land in dense jungle outside the city of Iziz. A Rebel contact — a Togruta woman named **Ashka Dey** — meets them at a hidden camp.

**Ashka's briefing:**
- The Empire is building something in the ruins of the ancient Sith temple outside the city
- Heavy security: an Imperial garrison of 40+ troops, plus an Inquisitor has been seen
- The local resistance wants to help but is divided — half want to fight, half want to negotiate
- Players need to: (1) scout the temple, (2) figure out what the weapon is, (3) decide how to stop it

**Player choices:**
- Sneak into the city for information (Moderate Sneak, 15; Streetwise, 15 to find informants)
- Scout the temple perimeter directly (Moderate Sneak, 15; Search, 15 to map defenses)
- Meet the resistance leaders (Moderate Persuasion, 15 to gain their trust)

## Act 2: The City of Iziz

**Goal:** Gather intel on the Imperial project and build local alliances.

**Complications (pick 2-3):**
1. **The Market:** A black market dealer named Vek sells Imperial comm frequencies for 400 credits or a favor — he wants a competitor's cargo shipment "redirected." Moral choice: steal from another smuggler?
2. **Resistance Split:** Leader Jobal wants an all-out assault. Leader Mira wants to evacuate civilians first. Players must choose a side or find a compromise (Difficult Persuasion, 20 to unite them).
3. **Imperial Patrol:** Stormtroopers conducting random searches in the market district. Players can avoid (Sneak, 15), bluff through (Con, 15), or fight (4 troopers + 1 sergeant).
4. **The Inquisitor:** A dark-robed figure moves through the streets. Force-sensitive characters feel cold dread (Sense check, 15 to gauge power level: this one is dangerous but young — a former Jedi Padawan). The Inquisitor is hunting Force users. If Zeph uses the Force openly, the Inquisitor will track them.

## Act 3: The Sith Temple

**The weapon:** The Empire is excavating an ancient Sith superweapon — a massive kyber crystal array that can project a concentrated energy beam from orbit. It's not Death Star scale, but it could destroy a city. They're weeks from activation.

**The temple interior:** Dark, claustrophobic tunnels carved with ancient Sith writing. Traps still active after millennia:
- **Pressure plates:** Moderate Perception (15) to spot; Moderate Dexterity (15) to avoid; 4D damage if triggered
- **Force illusions:** The Dark Side is strong here. Characters see visions of their fears. Moderate Willpower (15) or be shaken (lose 1D from all actions for 5 rounds)
- **Sentry droids:** Ancient but functional. 3D Blaster, 2D Dodge, Armor +1D. Two guarding the crystal chamber.

**The crystal chamber:** The kyber crystal array is massive — six crystals in a focusing ring. Imperial technicians are calibrating it under guard (6 Stormtroopers, 1 officer, 2 technicians).

**Climax options:**
- **Sabotage:** Tok-3 can reprogram the array to overload (Very Difficult Computer Prog, 25, or Difficult with 2 rounds of uninterrupted work, 20). Overload destroys the weapon but the explosion will collapse the temple — 3 rounds to escape.
- **Steal a crystal:** Remove one kyber crystal (Moderate Strength, 15) to disable the array without destroying it. The Rebels could use it. But it alerts the Inquisitor immediately.
- **Full assault:** With resistance fighters (if allied), storm the chamber. 6 troopers + the officer. The Inquisitor arrives in round 4.
- **Negotiate:** If the Inquisitor is the former Padawan, Zeph can try to reach them (Very Difficult Persuasion, 25, but with advantage if Zeph reveals Force sensitivity — reduce to Difficult, 20). Success: the Inquisitor hesitates, buys time. Failure: lightsaber duel.

**The Inquisitor — Seventh Sister (apprentice):**
- Dex 3D+2, Kno 3D, Mec 2D, Per 3D+1, Str 2D+2, Tec 2D
- Skills: Lightsaber 6D, Dodge 5D, Sense 4D, Intimidation 5D
- Weapons: Double-bladed lightsaber (5D+2 damage)
- Tactics: Tests opponents first. Taunts. Will retreat if clearly outmatched (she's smart, not suicidal).

**Resolution:** Players escape Onderon with intel (or a kyber crystal, or an unlikely ally). The Rebel Alliance now knows the Empire is weaponizing Sith artifacts — setting up a larger campaign.

## GM Notes
- The Inquisitor encounter can be scaled. If the party is struggling, the Inquisitor is overconfident and makes mistakes. If they're steamrolling, the Inquisitor is calculating and calls for reinforcements.
- Onderon's jungle provides natural cover (+1D to Sneak/Dodge when in dense foliage).
- The moral choices matter: how the players treat the resistance, whether they steal from Vek's competitor, whether they try to redeem the Inquisitor — these shape the crew's reputation for future adventures.
- If a kyber crystal is taken, it becomes a campaign MacGuffin. The Empire wants it back. The Rebels want to study it. And the Force users feel it calling...
