# The Kathol Outback

**Type:** Multi-session campaign arc
**Players:** 2-4
**Era:** Classic trilogy (weeks after "Shadows of Onderon")
**Tone:** Deep space exploration, alien cultures, Dark Side mysteries
**Prerequisite:** Shadows of Onderon (crew has intel on Imperial Sith weapon programs)

## Hook
The intel from Onderon reveals that Moff Sarne — the architect of the Empire's Sith weapons program — has fled into the remote Kathol sector with a fleet of loyalist ships. The Rebel Alliance tasks the crew to pursue Sarne aboard the FarStar, a captured Corellian corvette. But the Kathol Outback is uncharted, dangerous, and home to ancient secrets that predate the Republic.

## The FarStar
The crew's new ship is a modified CR90 corvette captured from Moff Sarne's forces:
- Bridge, engine room, cargo bay, crew quarters, med bay, brig
- Crew complement: 30+ NPC crew members
- Carries the Rusty Mynock in the docking bay as a shuttle/scout ship

## Campaign Structure
The Kathol Outback arc spans multiple planets, each a self-contained module:
- **Kal'Shebbol departure** — Launch from the sector capital
- **Kolatill** — First stop, fuel and supplies, pirate ambush
- **Gandle Ott** — Ancient ruins, DarkStrider artifacts, local politics
- **Kathol Rift** — Navigate the rift anomaly, space encounters
- **Kathol itself** — Final confrontation with Sarne

## Pre-Generated Characters
Same crew as previous modules, with earned CP/FP carried forward.

## NPCs
- **Moff Kentor Sarne** — Imperial warlord, cunning tactician
- **Kaiya Adrimetrum** — FarStar first officer, by-the-book military
- **Loh'khar** — Twi'lek con artist, FarStar crew, always scheming
- **Gorak Khzam** — Rodian security chief, paranoid but reliable

## GM Notes
- This is a framework — each planet visit becomes its own module with maps and encounters
- The DarkStrider is an ancient alien entity from before the Republic — its artifacts are the source of Sarne's power
- Player choices from earlier modules carry forward: resistance alliances, kyber crystals, Inquisitor status
